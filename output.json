I think your expectations are too big for a KTM satellite brand. The only part that's exactly the same is the engine. The latest version though which was been refined over the 8 year of production (twinspark). We will see if the 690 will transform into the new 701 and disappear from the KTM lineup to make space for a parallel twin as people rumored for 2017, or perhaps the more evident move, a new 690 Enduro, sporting the 2016 Duke engine which is very interesting to say the least (secondary balancing shaft in the head, 74Hp with Euro 5 emission, OLED dash, Traction Control, etc) IMHO the rear subframe/tank is the best solution for an adventure/rally base, and the 690/701 are really great at it. There are aftermarket solutions for tanks in the front with different capacity, as well as fairing solutions. I don't have to remind anyone that the bike design that dominated the hardest race on the planet (Dakar Rally) has an identical setup: rear tank/subframe , CrMo trellis frame, two front tanks with low center of gravity and great mass centralisation and a fairing/nav tower.","page":6},{"post":"","page":6},{"post":"Steering head angle seems to be changed from 63 degrees to 44 degrees, so something has definitely changed :)","page":6},{"post":"That is a mistake (typo). Like the Brembo 4 pot radial brakes (actually specs from 701 SUMO). Angle is still 63dg since the frame is the same for the Sumo version (SUMO specs is 63). The interesting part is the frame reinforcement bars which have different position compared to the 690 frame. If we look closely the bars near the headstem are closer in geometry to the new 2015 450 Rally Factory bike. This allows a smaller angle between the two lower bars that starts from the headstem which actually interfere with the fork tube and set the maximum steering lock.

Assuming the 701 is, for all practical purposes, the 690 Enduro, and the KTM version is to be discontinued, then my preferred dealer (and the only KTM dealer in my area) will simply not carry them, despite the 690 having probably been his most successfully-selling among all street-legal KTMs. I'm sure he's still not going to set up an additional separate Husky dealership just to continue selling the 701. I can understand, for example, Honda's requiring separate dealerships for its motorcycles and its power products or watercraft. But the whole KTM/Husky thing is, in my mind, more akin to Yamaha/Star or Kawasaki/Vulcan or Suzuki/Boulevard, at least from the potential buyer's perspective. I mean, it looks like KTM wants to eventually brand its off-road race bikes KTM, and its non-competition bikes Husky, just to keep a marquee alive (or merely resurrected). In the US market, it seems to me to just confuse the customer; always an impediment to sales. I'm not a dealer and no one has told me this directly, but I've come to suspect from reading between the lines that a KTM dealer can't just order n bikes of a particular model he that he knows he can sell in his market area; he has to select multi-model \"packages\" which offer minimal flexibility. He ends up with a glut of expensive models for which there just isn't any interest in his primary market (his area of expertise, not KTM's). Maybe all brands have similar requirements to some measure, but if so, I suspect to a much less restrictive degree. I wonder if that's not part of the evidently wide-spread \"shortage\" of available 690 Enduros. JET","page":1},{"post":"","page":1},{"post":"Looks like the enduro version has real WP forks on it.

They killed a lot of the mom and pop stores that kept KTM alive during the lean years. KTM has not increased its manufacturing capacity yet they added all of those KTM dealerships. Husky set up their own worldwide dealer network (often piggybacked onto an existing KTM dealership). KTM is (once again) requiring that dealers take models of bikes that don't sell in their area of operations. For example, in the northwest most dealerships sell 9 XC / XCW bikes to every SX bike they sell. Who in the NW really wants the big Superduke or the RC8 (surprisingly the 390's sell pretty good), yet they can sell every 690 / Adventure they can get their hands on. KTM is forcing the dealers to take in more SX's and more of the big street bikes in order to get the big adventure bikes and the XC / XCW bikes. Part of this is due to KTM winning the SX and MX titles this year. KTM is also forcing dealerships to buy increasing larger numbers of bikes overall in order to get the bikes that sell well in their area. As an example, a dealer historically sells 27-32 XC / XCW bikes a year. This year they ordered 30 XC / XCW bikes and were told they would get less than half of that order, and that in order to get those bikes they had to take 12 SX bikes. This is for a dealership that sells maybe 2 SX bikes a year and has done so for the past 6 years. The \"funny\" thing? Husky is more than willing to make up for the loss of the KTM's, but they can't provide the numbers of bikes that the dealership wants because of limited Husky production. KTM and Husky are competing with each other for manufacturing capacity, not sales. KTM is still cranking out (example) 20 \"dirt bikes\" a day, but a third of those bikes are now \"Husky's\", so that one third less bikes hitting the KTM showrooms. Add in the new KTM dealerships and you'll see why there is a KTM \"shortage\" of bikes. For Husky to start producing their own bikes KTM is going to need to increase production, expand or Husky needs to move into its own production facility. KTM's are going to be Husky's and Husky's are going to be KTM's until this happens.","page":9}]

I'm 6'4\" (193cm) and have a 34\" (86ish cm) inseam and absurdly long arms. Am I likely to need bar risers? It seems like a tall bike but I don't have a ton of experience.

Think about it, a tall person with long arms will reach down to the same point as a shorter person with shorter arms. Stand next to a shorter friend with your arms straight at your sides and I'll bet your finger tips are at nearly the same level. On the bike, the angle of the tall persons arms will be steeper, so moving the bars slightly forward will help there. I hate to ruffle feathers, but this is a subject that has always bothered me on this forum. I just don't understand the desire to ride around standing bolt upright... that \"style\" must have started right here on ADV. Standing benefits you offroad if you are in the \"attack\" position, slightly crouched, knees bent, elbows up/out, so that your body can act as suspension and allow the bike to dance under you. Standing won't do you any good if your knees are locked. You won't have as good leverage against the bike if the bars are in your lap or against your chest! If you feel the need to stand to \"stretch your legs\" get a tall seat/ lower pegs (low pegs have the same affect as bar risers when standing, but take some angle off of your knees when seated), if it's because your bum is aching get a more comfortable seat. I'm 6'5\" with absurdly long arms too (6'10.5\" \"wingspan\", 38-39 sleeve) and tried bar risers for a very short period of time and all they seemed to do was make the seated position more cramped and made it more difficult to get my weight forward to rail a corner. My sub-mounted stabilizer raised the bars about 1/2\" and that put the bars up just about as high as I'm willing to tolerate. With long arms, using the forward most bar position will do you more good than raising the bars. I find the 690 to be cramped in the peg-seat distance, but pretty good in the seat-bar distance (reach.) The 701 looks to use the same peg mounts, so unless they raised the seat height (more than just the 25mm of increased travel over the current 690), I'm guessing the angle of your legs (when seated) will be the same cramped (for a 34\" inseam) position as it is on the 690.","page":19},{"post":"","page":19},{"post":"On the 701 Enduro they switched back to 22-24 offset. 30-32 is on the sumo version.","page":19},{"post":"","page":19},{"post":"Well, there it is. First impression: I love it ! (Apart from this being a supermoto version) Looks very nicely built with a lot of detail to it. Clutch is veeeery light to operate (one finger easy !) and ergonomics were good for me at 175 cm in height. Could reach the floor with my toes which is fine for me. The enduro version has bigger wheels but possibly more sag so height should be equal I think. LED lights all round apart from the headlight. Indicators are bendy enough and have a rugged feel to them. Dash is nice and compact and has an ABS button on it to select setting(s). Unfortubately it wasn't ready to ride and wasn't connected up so no playing around or hearing the exhaust note. Taking luggage with you might prove a bit of a challenge as the bike is very wide at the place where you ideally hang your (soft) bags. On one side is the exhaust and on the other part of the fuel tank. Standing up wasn't that good but seeing this being the SM model it probably has lower handlebars. I had the idea the brake and shifter were a bit far forward from the pegs but I didn't have my boots (size 9) on so maybe that's an illusion. The seat has some info on the bottom where is displays the chain tension and the various possible settings for the suspension. That same seat comes of fairly easily with two press studs on the front and one pull cord for the rear end of it. It is not lockable which is a shame. On the other side, there's very little room under it. Fuelcap is behind the seat so that might be inconvenient if you have a rack with luggage on it. Ignition key is just before the steering head. Might be an idea to protect that if you have a tank bag because if you hit something and crash into the bag, the key might break off but maybe I'm chasing shadows here. This bike had a black seat but the importer (for Holland) who was there told me there will be a different seat in blue/white /yellow available in March. (the bike comes with two seats new) He also told me the Cafe Racer type thing (Svartpilen) will be brought out 2017 if I understood right.

In other words, even with attack position taller folks like myself have to crouch more than a shorter, which leads to more fatigue and pain in lower back. I don't want the bars up and in my lap, but I also don't want to be reaching and crouching excessively either. It's nice that you find it ok, but just cause some of us find attack position more comfortable with raised bars doesn't mean we want to stand bolt upright while riding, that's quite the ASSumption.

[{"post":"Coming from an XRR it´s quite different. Powerdelivery is very smooth, suspension a bitt on the soft side with standard springs for med. As I´m 100kg+ I will upgrade the springs as soon as it´s poosible to order them. There are no vibrations compared with the XRR and it´s very quiet. And when you rev it a bit it really moves and feels very light and agile.

It's the very same shitty system (and most parts) that \"features\" on the X range of bikes. The locking mechanics have to be turned by the key. This is not operating very smoothly but that could be down to it being new. The thing that possibly going to bugger things is that on the 701 it sits flat so the lock can collect water/dirt/dust and so the lock might become inoperable. There are various riders that have snapped their key off trying to open the fuel cap... There's a little plastic \"circle\" on the cover for the lock but that doesn't have a seal on it.

The XR has great bottom grunt but the Husky seems to have much more power when you rev it. I must admit it's not that big difference in lower RPM's. The bike is tall and the seat is wide. It feels like about 5 cm taller than XR650R when you sit on it. When you ride the bike more reminds me of an enduro and seems very easy to handle. Haven't really tested the suspension but it seems stiff for me who is around 80 kg and 190 cm tall. I'm going to ride single track, high way, gravel and whatever there is between.

You say they're the same but you would choose one over the other because of the differences.

Some of you guys say that a couple of different screws and the color of the plastic make them different. I say that it takes more than some different colored plastic and different screws to make it a stand alone bike. The last years of Husaberg the bikes were nothing more than different colored KTM's. It's been said that KTM bought Husaberg for the RS engine and some people even said that some KTM's were nothing more than rebadged Husabergs for the first couple of years. You still don't get the whole platform sharing thing, do you. VW makes the Volkswagen Passat, that is the same basic platform for the Audi A4. Are they the same car? Yes. The Toyota Avalon is the basis for the Lexus ES. Same car? Yes. The Kawasaki KLX 400 and Suzuki DRZ400, same bike? Yes. I get where you're coming from. Really, I do. Mona Lisa Vito: The car that made these two, equal-length tire marks had positraction. You can't make those marks without posi-traction, which was not available on the '64 Buick Skylark! Vinny Gambini: And why not? What is posi-traction? Mona Lisa Vito: It's a limited slip differential which distributes power equally to both the right and left tires. The '64 Skylark had a regular differential, which, anyone who's been stuck in the mud in Alabama knows, you step on the gas, one tire spins, the other tire does nothing. [the jury members nod, with murmurs of \"yes,\" \"that's right,\" etc] Vinny Gambini: Is that it? Mona Lisa Vito: No, there's more! You see? When the left tire mark goes up on the curb and the right tire mark stays flat and even? Well, the '64 Skylark had a solid rear axle, so when the left tire would go up on the curb, the right tire would tilt out and ride along its edge. But that didn't happen here. The tire mark stayed flat and even. This car had an independent rear suspension. Now, in the '60's, there were only two other cars made in America that had positraction, and independent rear suspension, and enough power to make these marks. One was the Corvette, which could never be confused with the Buick Skylark. The other had the same body length, height, width, weight, wheel base, and wheel track as the '64 Skylark, and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest. Vinny Gambini: And because both cars were made by GM, were both cars available in metallic mint green paint? Mona Lisa Vito: They were! Vinny Gambini: Thank you, Ms. Vito. No more questions. Thank you very, very much.

I also think that we are saying about the same thing but see it differently. Choosing a motorcycle is often tied up around emotion and feel but as you have pointed out there are subtle real differences that may drive a decision to purchase one over another. VW Golf or Audi A3. The Golf costs less but the Audi provides a little nicer driving experience. Essentially the same but they attract a different buyer. KTM 690 or Husky 701. Well, if you want an SM and you live in the US your only choice is Husky. If you want a DS then you might choose KTM or Husky based on price, fuel range, looks, brand image, suspension characteristics, or dealer preference. The buyer has more options and the manufacturer attracts a broader range of buyers for little extra investment. Platform sharing.

[{"post":"Hi Dutchgit, Thanx a lot for your report!!! Husqvarna said: Made of high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel the 701 ENDURO’s lightweight trellis frame has been developed to offer optimum feedback for both on road and offroad use. Combining a perfect weight distribution with a tight turning circle the trellis frame harnesses the power of the single-cylinder engine, guaranteeing flawless agility and stability in all kinds of riding conditions. My question to you: Is the 701 turning circle a litle bit better than the 690 or a lot?

Should be here shortly. The Britannia Lynx R fairing will be on its way within the next few days. We'll see what fits. The bad news is I got busted today... Twice... For barking too loud... Nopper, the R40's are fine without a rack but the R80 (2.0 comes in May) would need a rack I would think (I'm not talking from experience). I'm going to make my own rack. However, I did buy the Touratech hoops prefab because my tooling doesn't allow for such a tight radius on the hoop. And I want to be compatible with the Perun plates. Though I really like the idea of the Scouts being able to take them of like a 'quick release' I sort of think they add too much weight. (the mount). The whole point of the 690/701 to me is as little weight as possible. When I build my rack I will also consider space on the inside for a fuel solution. I personally think the Rotopax design is not motorcycle friendly. Sure it mounts easy but it wastes a lot of volume on handles and such that you really don't need on a bike. If you take the outer dimensions and calculate the volume it is a total waste of space. Take a 1 gallon Rotopax and its outer dimensions. In Metrics a 1 Gallon Rotopax: 24,13cm x 33,65cm x 7,62cm = 6178 cubic cm. That's 6,178 liters yet a gallon is 3,78 liters. What a waste of space on a small vehicle such as a motorcycle! To be fair I subtracted an assumed 4mm wall thickness and that would still amount to 5,696 liters for a canister that holds 3,78 liters. Of course you can't fill it 100% because you need some airbuffer too compensate for expansion etc etc. It's just a waste of motorcyle-rack-real-estate. And they are also very expensive when you also buy the mount. Not that there's much alternative. I'm considering building a rack and using two FuelFriend canisters that together make up for 4 liters, are smaller and much cheaper. The disadvantage is that you have two canisters to fill and to deal with and they lack the mounting option of the Rotopax. The 1,5 liter FuelFriends though have a primitive mounting option and they are nice.","page":43},{"post":"","page":43},{"post":"I got my new footpegs today, and they fit without any problems. http://motobau.de/product_info.php?...cm-lower-rallye-footpegs-for-all-ktm-690.html","page":43},{"post":"Looking good!

[{"post":"OK, you're right but it depends on how you travel. If you need top of the line aluminum panniers the cost for a Touratech Zega system for the 690 is the same price as for a KLR or R1200GS Adventure so it has nothing to do with the 690 itself and a 690 Adventure with luggage would cost that much more than an Enduro anyway. Luggage is luggage no matter what bike you mount it to, it all costs the same. If you already own the Zega panniers from another bike a stainless steel rack for the 690 (or any other bike) is $400. A safari tank is $800 US but the Rade Garage is under $350. Seat Concepts $170, MRA windscreen under $100.

Getting your 690 fork to the exact specifications of a 500EXC for example it's just a matter of ~300E in parts + the labour if you are not confident in doing it yourself. Same for the CC 4CS (standard on Six Days EXC's, SX's and all enduro Husky's). The only problem with this base setup is that the vibe in the hard enduro community is not over positive on the 4CS.

Advanced map gets you there even quicker. On the other hand, the Rotax of 650XC has way better fuel economy than LC4, and is generally a very bullet proof engine for tens of thousands of kilometers with just basic maintenance. Nice EFI, too.

On account of the passenger pegs, the Mojave stays put a lot better than it does on my Beta 498 RR because I am able to create tension from down lower with the forward straps. On the Beta (no passenger pegs), I had to loop the forward straps on the frame, which made it easier for the sidebags to \"flap\" in the rough stuff. Annoyingly, the Mojave does not fit well with the grab rails installed. I tried to mount the rear on top of the rails last night but with the pack that far back, I ended up with a lot of flapping due to lack of downward tension. Shame, really, because mounted that way it leaves the gas cap accessible. I have an old prototype Great Basin and it fits really well with the grab rails. Doesn't leave much room for a passenger but there is plenty for me. Aesthetically, it looks a bit big and drowns the bike somewhat (God I am terrible) but it is really convenient and very snug. A Coyote would be perfect so will pick one up when back in the U.S. next month. Here are some pics of the Great Basin on the bike.

Seat foam thins out a LOT that far back and the suspension still isn't broken in. That being said, she had lots of fun and commented on how hard it pulls for a dirt bike with a passenger. Now that I am beating fully on the engine with the Advanced fuel map, I have to say that it feels like it pulls as hard as an SV650 - at least! If my modded XR650R back in the day could be likened to a big block that rips off the line but chokes out early, then this 701/690 motor feels like a screaming small block.

It's probably a safer bet to look for precedent in the motorcycle industry, but as with the the computer industry, it may make sense to just release an updated bike rather than sit on the technology, even if it means last year's buyers get a little angry.

Most modern ignition and fuel systems on bikes currently compensate dramatically and effectively to differences in oxygen and fuel loads etc. that a simple slip on exhaust can would do. In fact in my own racing experiences any amount of flow (intake, port, airbox and exhaust) that is changed is effectively managed by the current crop of computer ignitions and sensors. This is based on current production superbike racing and mods. So... IF the Husky is that advanced and I honestly dont know - but if it is then any amount of changes to flow from a slip on can, full exhaust or airbox tweaks will be brought right back down to the intended benchmarks. Exactly the same way they would if you went from sea level to 10,000 feet or 40c to 9c... So I would suggest (very cautiously) that no matter what you do to your exhaust it will not cause any trouble at all and only run perhaps better but with the exact same fuel/air mixture and appropriate ignition. BUT - that is not to say that if you get a can AND change the maps you could see great gains in performance... that is for certain... but I dont think it is an ISSUE for the bike to run that way.

I have read that there have been some changes to the geometry between the 690 and 701; perhaps this has calmed the bike down. Mods to mine so far: Wings tailpipe Vibrinators Mods soon to come: KTM Rally Footpegs (essential!) 5mm thick bash plate which I'll extend myself to cover the rear master cylinder MST Fairing (have it already but waiting til' winter to fit) SOMETHING done to that terribly hard seat! Possibly the auxiliary tanks (when the eventually come out!) Tool tube that will attach to the front of the bash plate 15mm bar risers The bike is everything I was expecting, and more!

I believe I had to remove 6 screws that mount the top cover, two on top, two on the back, and two from below. I removed the cover by pulling up on the rear so that the screw hole bracket could clear the black plastic fender section above the brake light. Then pull up on the front so it clears the gas cap hole (gas cap of course must be removed) and slide it back. I also pushed down on the middle to help it slide off. To install I pushed down on the middle section while pulling up on the rear, I had to slide it on and off several times to test fit the holes. Be careful drilling the holes, the rear only has two divots without the bigger circle markers and my drill bit got caught up and grabbed the plastic instead of making a smooth hole, I started with a small hole and used round rasps/files to widen them via test fitting several times, would have been much easier if they had the same circle markers that the side panels have. I'd be interested to hear if anyone removed the whole fender to do the work, It just seemed like too much of a pain so I played around with it and found you can just flex it to pop it off.","page":98}]

I changed at 60 miles with virtually zero metal or such on the filters/strainers - I mean nothing and again when I changed it at 600 miles. Switched to Mobil 1 0-40 with Scott's stainless steel oil filters with first change. Synthetic from the beginning, no oil consumption issues. There have been a few guys with oil consumption issues, seems to clear up with some miles, have not heard of anyone with long term oil consumption problems. I feel better with the 0-40 oil versus 10-60, see voluminous discussions on Cafe Husky regarding lower weight oil. Note that per the 690 forums KTM has been having issues with filters collapsing using the heavy weight oil - they have been recommending prefilling the oil filters on oil changes to avoid the filter collapse issue. I had a dealer in town tell me that there was some \"Special\" break in oil from the factory and I should have left it in for the full initial 600 mile run in.......Really.....and I'm not going to run oil for 6K miles as well.......by the way, the book says 1.7L oil, I've been using 2L, no blow by in filter box. More oil is better. Also switched to the Australian UNI foam filter after I found dust in the airbox. Most of us 690 guys using the OEM paper filter got our airboxes dusted. After I switched to the Australian UNI with a bead of wheel bearing grease to seal it - no more dust. I have a magnetic drain plug from the factory, hope you do too. I love this motorcycle.

I'm not sure if the HDB dash mount is the same as used on KTM dirt bikes. It is what Paul sent me when I told him I wanted to raise the 701 dash. He checked with Trailtech (the dash manufacturer) to determine the form factor. The dash mount was something he had in stock because my order arrived in 2 days.

The other settings 4-9 could be anything but are supposed to be all the same. It should also be noted that this switch controls ignition mapping not fuel injection mapping.

The description says 3 modes but I believe the switch only has two positions from other research. I believe you set the under seat switch to whatever 2nd mode you want, bad gas, soft, advanced. The switch always has a \"standard\" position and the 2nd position is whatever you set the switch under the seat to. I'll probably set it up for \"standard\" + \"soft\". Any in the know on this switch, can you confirm how it works on 690's, is my understanding correct? Also, regarding EU turn signals I ordered them from http://www.ktm-versand.de as well as the flash module, part numbers I ordered are: 2x 60314026000 FLASHER R/S 2x 60314025000 FLASHER L/S 1x 76011030000 BLINKGEBER LED 6,25W I'm hoping that is all I need and they work as they are not cheap and shipping is about $50 from Germany to the US. I'll post up the results once I've received/installed them if I don't hear from any other US conversions in the meantime. My left rear turn signals was getting black but the Wings exhaust seems to help minimize this, I'm hoping the LED's will remove this concern all together and eliminate the need to worry about burnt out bulbs. Also... I don't know if they will do it again but I originally didn't order the \"Blinkgeber\", I phoned them up and they agreed to send it via standard envelope which cost me $4.50 instead of $50 in shipping but they said it can't be tracked, figured it's worth rolling the dice for that much savings on a small part that weighs almost nothing.

Haven't seen as many posts about the Supermoto, so figured I would follow up with what I've learned calling around to dealers on the west coast the past couple of days... At best, dealers are getting 1 Supermoto each. Some got none. I called every dealer in California, and every one already had a deposit on their SM. None of the California dealers I spoke to had the bike delivered yet. Enduros are another story, many of them received 3-4 bikes, and not all of them are spoken for. I expanded my search and was able to find a SM out of state and put down a deposit this past week. They got the bike delivered in the crate a couple days ago, which is the first I've heard on the west coast, but others may have more info on availability. Most dealers I spoke to estimated end of March delivery. My bike's now ready to go, but I need to wait for delivery Apparently there was also confusion on the warranty coverage Husqvarna USA was offering. My dealer said they received a bulletin clarifying that the warranty for the new 701's was 2 year / 24,000 mile. I got some picture of the SM fresh out of the crate, and it has the black seat.

If the 701 cannot adjust to no db killer then the risk is too lean a mixture and potential to damage. I have read elsewhere on this site that the 690 KTM cannot adjust to 'no' db killer without a remap. Also read the Wings is ok with the KTM 690 with either db killer but not with no db killer. The 701 mapping is clearly different than the KTM based on all the reviews remarking on the improved throttle response of the 701 motor. So for now not sure anyone knows about running the 701 with no db killer. I would leave the db killer in until solid info is available on the 701 electronics.

I have owned a 690 since they came out (a couple 08's, an 09, a 13 and a 14 model). Been averaging over 7,500 miles per year on these machines with most of those being on gravel and primitive roads as well as multiple day trips. I really like the ergo's of the 701. Appreciate the fact the bars are of the same bend as my 501 and 300 and like how my knees now rest on the padding of the seat when standing vs the seat/shroud juncture of the 690. That juncture would over time bruise the knees. I feel lucky the bike was delivered with the black seat as the texture and cover material of the colored seat is not to my liking. A couple things I do miss from the 690 however are a) how the dongle works -- no longer able to have full abs, b) miss my tail rack -- but imagine one will be available soon, c) miss the fact I was able to toggle between odometer modes via a momentary switch mounted on the handlebars and the fact I could adjust the odo wheel size to get accurate speed readings, d) can't believe I am saying this but the gear indicator mode of the 14 model odo. Used that merely to avoid trying to find that elusive 7th gear. Without a tach that is more of an issue, e) the roadbook carrier, that allowed mounting of the gps above the odo and f) miss the windscreen -- but I have almost completed some mods that move the headlight out and up which probably will solve the later two items.","page":121},{"post":"Question - I am confused as I thought that the 701 has full abs as standard - on - off switch on the dash.

I believe their flat-rate shipping to the US is $50 and this is on par with ktm-versande.de shipping costs which I also recommend as they have been great to work with and they helped save me a lot in shipping costs for the small parts which I didn't realize I needed and had to place in a separate order. Note that for small parts ordered internationally where you are OK not having it tracked that a \"DHL Envelope\" is significantly less expensive than typical DHL flat rate shipping in the range of $50 vs. $5.

No regrets with my purchase and consolidating 3 bikes for this. Almost pulled the trigger on an 1190R, glad I didnt. 7 hour round trip to pick up and 8 hours of prep at the dealer yesterday, looong day. If your dealer did not grease the steering head and swing arm bearings, highly recommended you take a look. I should have taken a pic, a light coating of grease would be exagerating! I only got 1 seat, the colored one. Its going to Renazco in May (suede blue with yellow stitching) OEM air filter...note the gap exposing the orange seal on the paper filter. Here is the Australian UniFilter and pre filter installed. Will be keeping an eye on this Cycra hand guards. Blue is not an exact match, but very close. New DoubleTake Adventure mirrors. Ready for a test ride! The Wings sounds great. However, same with the oem muffler, it is starting to turn the turn signal black after 50 miles. No worries, gonna replace with HyperLites anyway. Now to sign some paperwork and hand over some $$$$ Discoverd the Cycra's block the idiot/warning lights...gonna have to work on that. Some ADV bling Swapped the TKC80's for Pirelli A/T 90's, HD tubes, rim locks and balanced....lots of weight to balance! I have changed a lot of tires in my day...that rear was one of, if not THE toughest tire swap ever. So here are my likes/dis-likes in 50 miles... Love the engine, smooth power delivery, little vibes up top but nothing Im worried about and should smooth out after some miles. Suspension feels planted in the corners on gravel, very confident inspiring. Didnt have an opportunity to test the bumps, too flat here. Brakes are great, but the ABS dongle shit has me a little confused. Key OFF, Switch OFF, Key ON, Switch ON, Start gets me ABS front wheel only. Key OFF, Switch ON,Key ON, Start...turns OFF ABS. Without unplugging the dongle, not sure how to get full ABS. By the way, the first two were verified on gravel. Oxford heated grips would not fit. My throttle tube is smooth not ribbed like others I've seen. Diameters are off, Im still working on it..havent given up yet. Front fender was rubbing bottom of radiator..some washers fixed that.

I have to tell you that it damn near pitched me over the front when that happened (from standing position), but thinking it through pointed to my foot position. I have been taking it fairly easy on the revs, so that might account for the false neutrals. I am not light on the lever effort, so that theory is out. I have seen some others use a fix from the ktm world and will look into that if I can't find that happy ground with my own riding style.

After a couple of months and about 2K Km I've been able to progressively enjoy what the 701 can offer. Not an enduro bike - too heavy for that - and TKCs don't help either. Not a road bike neither. Instead, the 701 can easily do anything in between ... not many bikes can take you where this one will. Particularly the suspension has indeed caused a good impression. Amazing, should I say. Fuel economy and range is not bad, compared to the SXC - with a 11,2L 640 tank - I can easily brake the 200Km mark, whilst the 625 wouldn't take me to 140. Last tank was a 12,51L replenishment for a very much enjoyed off-road 211 Km. As for the false neutrals, I had a few. But I believe they were mostly my fault. In fact, they seldom occur now. Just shift with some more determination and that's it. Not annoying to me whatsoever, it's difficult to find the cons. There are a few, however. But pros are so many and so obvious that you easily forget them. I've been playing with the mapping small roulette adjuster, preferred the number two position. Not convinced, though. 1/8 to 1/4 openings are not what I would like. And it doesn't seem to get better - to me - with the other options.

Not having the correct bolt, I would have simply removed the hand guards and used the clutch side bolt (which is too long) with a few small washers or a spacer at the bottom of that bolt rather than putting a spacer on the hand guard.

You can put the washers/spacer on the bottom where it is pretty much out of sight and out of the way, but I don't agree that using the hand guard mount (after cutting away the hand guard) as a spacer is a better solution. But the other issue you raise is that the hand guards don't really fit the 701 bar bend very well. The spacer on the hand guard is one way of dealing with the poor fit. The levers are adjustable and you can bring them a bit closer to the bar by changing the lever adjusters.

Everything fit like a glove. The only problem was that some moron though it'd be a great idea to use the clutch lever mounting bolt to secure the stock handguards. If you remove the bracket for the guards: a) the bolt is too long, and b) the nut it screws into is gone since it is molded into the guard mount. Rekleinerider's passenger grab rails came with a spare nut and bolt to remedy this problem, but I was not as lucky. I just used a hacksaw and cut the portion of the mount off that holds the nut (and the portion that the bolt passes through) and used some vice grips to secure it while I tightened the bolt. Might use a dremel tool to make it look nice, but it's functional and hardly noticeable as is. Also, DirtJack already mentioned this but the banjo bolt on the front brake reservoir needs to be rotated slightly. Easy peasy. The only other issue is the lower quarter of the speedometer is hidden by the top clamp (for me at least, I'm 5'11\" with a 32\" inseam) which isn't a problem for me since this bike will be ridden mostly off-road, but it might get a bit annoying if riding slab is your thing.","page":136},{"post":"","page":136},{"post":"Thanks, I just ordered mine slightly different, got a ADV top clamp just in case.","page":136},{"post":"","page":136}][{"post":"mine melted at 30 miles, local dealer ordered a new one up on warranty, arrived with no hassle.

I used an longer M10 stainless steel allen head bolt to compensate for the taller risers. 15mm just wasn't enough for me to live comfortably. Well, Two hours after the 'Dude, it's time' moment I was sweating like pig in total panic, even though I really don't know if pigs sweat when they are in panic. That's how bad it was... For the first time in my life I got galled and I didn't even know there was such thing, let alone there was a word for it. Basically it means you get screwed to the point you can't unscrew it... I tried to loosen the M10 bolt in the triple clamps. Well, Holy Mother of Huskvarnu, they were almost welded in place. I had to take the triple clamp off the bike and even then, it took me close to an hour and a half with vise grips and other nasty tools to get these bolts out. The stainless bolt had almost welded itself to the Alu vibration rubber M10 thingy bolt. But sure enough, I finally got the bolt unstuck but with the consequence of really buggering the Alu vibration rubber M10 thingy bolt to the point of scrap metal... Again, I was sweating like pig in total panic and even though this was the second time before lunch I sweated like a pig in total panic, I couldn't verify whether pigs sweat when they are in panic because internet in the workshop had also seized. Just imagine the horror of it all... Then I had a moment. \"Dude, it's time. For God sake, raise the bar! You only live once! So I spent a few hours in the workshop turning a new alu vibration rubber M10 thingy bolt. I'm kind of proud of it. It's been awhile since I milled a hexagon. Anyway, I still don't know what went wrong. I Googled and discovered that I got galled. This means threads sort of weld together though I'm still not sure why? Was it the blue Lock Bond from Bison (loctite like stuff)? Was it an electro chemical reaction between stainless and aluminium or was it something as simple as an alien triple clamp invasion? We'll probably never find out but one thing is for sure. My new moto is UnCarpe Diem. Use anti-seize when stainless meets the alu vibration rubber M10 thingy bolt. Oh, by the way, I did notice that the risers really improved how the front wheel handles ABS braking in deep mud and while parking.","page":141},{"post":"","page":141},{"post":"Reading that I think it will be easier to just change the bars!","page":141},{"post":"","page":141},{"post":"You've got PM mail GB","page":141},{"post":"","page":141},{"post":"And replied too","page":141},{"post":"","page":141},{"post":"Didado you got skills my friend!

It took a few different designs but it is now finalized and in production (running the CNC machines today). The parts will need to go out for anodizing so it will probably be a week or two before they are ready to ship. Everything fits and looks like an OE part, one note in the pictures there is a gap on the side of the plastic shroud that goes over the ignition switch this is due to one of the prototype pin mounts they had tried but ended up not going with. Their plan is to sell the kit with the shroud already cut (they are trying to source these through Husqvarna at the moment) they will be CNC cutting the shroud so that the end user can keep their original and not have to cut it. They do not have the shrouds yet and do not have an ETA so you will have to ask if they will be sending later. I have not ridden the bike yet but I have no reason to doubt everything will work great. There is a 15mm rise from original. You can probably get another 15mm on top of that, I will be trying in the near future. Also the bars are mounted in the forward position 21mm from center of the steering stem.

The 701 is (esp SM version) a super smooth bike, compared to EXC. Its not smooth like multicylinder bikes, but it's powerful, flickable, fairly light. Is it 500EXC light? No. Would I take it to a MX track? No. Do I have to change oil every 10 hours like I have to do on my 525? No. Highway: A windscreen is a must, mine's in the mail. The 701SM is my daily rider now, I spend 10 miles on a tollway going 85-90mph. Yes, it's windy. But the engine is smooth and doesn't feel like it's about to rip itself to pieces (I had a DRZ400...try riding that at 70mph, with its 5 speed gearbox). The SM will get to 80mph in 3rd gear without problems. Up to 70mph I don't even feel/care about the wind. With SM tires the front is very stable, even without steering stab. I've test-ridden a 690E with road knobbies and front is somewhat shaky and you either need to get used to it, or better yet get a steering stab if you're going to do a lot of highway riding. Stock can is OK. I ride in earplugs all the time so I could care less what my exhaust sounds like... Skid plate is a must. AdventureSpec or Flatlands, depending where you are. AS is expensive (and to ship to US) but might be worth it. BarkBusters: E and SM both come with half-guards (the metal barend bar and plastic shield).

I've experienced too many screens that block the wind but produce turbulence and I prefer the clean air albeit a little too much of it. The reason I mentioned replacing the can isn't for sound but to get rid of the heat. My SE had catalytic converters that heated more like reactors. I'm assuming a similar situation exists on the 701, no? As for not riding my SE, I have 19,000 miles on it at this time. I don't ride it a lot but I do ride it, primarily off road. I've never considered it an investment. I do believe the reason for its value retention is that there isn't a new replacement bike like it. If someone releases a new bike that could be considered similiar I believe the used SE prices would fall. It's a tough call, I just wanted some feedback from current 701 owners.

I got your mail from our Husqvarna dealer Maurergep Kft. Regarding the false neutral shifting on the 701/690 gearbox (they are practically the same gearbox) I can say the following things. This gearbox had been designed for a KTM 690 supermoto, although e. g. the shifting drum is different. The difference is because of the different use of the enduro models and the more sportier HQV so this shifting system is requiring more force so it is more compliant for using with mx boots. As a side effect, when the shift lever pushed with less force, the shift star can stuck between gears so the false neutral can be shifted. When the lever is pushed with the normal force, with mx boots, the false neutral never happens. This is more of a feature, not a bug. Factory Pro had developed a shift locking lever with a ball bearing instead of a plain bearing solution. Factory Pro is an aftermarket company and has nothing to do with KTM. This kind of ball bearing locking levers tend to fail under high pressure because there is no constant spinning with force distribution on inner/outer race and no constant lubrication. That is why they offer a ceramic ball version but i do not recommend using this kit. It may lessen the force of shifting, so false neutral can be avoided but taking the risk of the bearing deterioration. This also happened with KTM roller bearing shift levers in the past as well. There were no problems of this gearbox, I hope yours also functioning flawlessly. Just give it a proper push/pull force and it is going to be okay. The oil quality only make a small difference as the friction is only marginally different, but if it is a better oil, more easier to shift more unlikely to get false neutrals. If you have any question, just do not hesitate to ask.

For example when you travel and add a lot of gear, make it a bit more stiff. But for now I don't have any comment yet on my suspension. The harder your suspension, the easier you lift the front wheel up since the less travel your back shock needs. I don't think temperatures influence that much. If you want try to wheely easily with still some safety built in: 1. put your foot on the rear brake and press it a little (this will already pull the bike down in it's rear suspension) 2. In the meanwhile you just add throttle until a fix rpm 3. While keeping your rear brake pressed in, quickly open the throttle a little bit, if you do this a few times you will feel the bike jump up a little bit. 4. Practice this a few times while you increase the throttle and the time to keep it open. ALWAYS keep you foot on your break pedal. If you feel going up to high; push the rear brake pedal and you will instantly come down. It's very difficult when your right hand is accelerating to move your left hand to the clutch, and this might even be too late, or the breaking force may be to small when you only use the clutch to reduce speed. 5. Do this in first or second gear and practice slowly, no need to pull it over from the first times. 6. Enjoy and only do in places where you don't bother/harm anybody with it. At least this is how they explained it to me when I followed some stunt lessons in Belgium. It works on any bike, even on a 250cc, only the rpm is different, and at least you can still control it. But I would never change my suspension just to wheely, I think you can mess up more with changing your suspension then improve something if you don't know what you're doing.","page":152},{"post":"Drill a small hole first, check that your holes line up, and extend hole sizes from there.

I had to make changes to the spacing of the front ABS spacer by trimming the sensor mount a bit and spacing the sensor back with a washer because the Warp 9 front rotor mounting points were not cut deep enough. On the back I was unable to use the Husky ABS ring, but Warp 9 supplied a thinner ABS ring, but I had still had to find rear rotor bolts with 3mm thick heads as the stock 4mm thick heads would not clear the caliper mount. Again on the rear rotor, the fastener mounting locations were not properly inset to allow the Husky ABS ring to be mounted. Very frustrating.

I started Enduro and off-Roed riding after moving to Thailand but have ridden must kind of bikes including a bit of road racing and have toured Thailand 60,000 km the last 3 years. I just spend the first two weeks and 2,500 km on my new 701, where 1,500 of them was on a four day trip with pillion. The bike is overall great and weight / power ratio is great, so is handling, suspension and brakes. It will properly also go as far off-road as a good old Kawa KLX 250 if you put on the right tires. However I found a couple of disappointing issues I would like to share: 1: Handlebar vibration over 90km/h are bad even though it has rubber mounts. I installed Xtrig to sort it out, but again why does Husky only do the job 50% when they are on it ? 2. The exhaust gets so hot all over that it melts everything that comes near including the left plastic cover when you ride with pillion. My GF got her fingers burned as well trying to catch the left passenger handle (and she wore gloves), so I would go so far and state that its dangerously hot and unprotected. I installed a Wings Titanium Exhaust and love it for sound, it doesn't get very hot, its a lot smaller and 3 kg lighter. 3. The seat is disappointing! Firstly there is stickers front and rear that pealed off before 500 km!!. Secondly it is less comfortable than on my pure off-road 501 which is ironic since the 701 is supposed to be for longer trips. All in all I don't regret my decision to go for the 701 but I'm a bit surprised that an old brand now owned by also experienced KTM can launch a bike with such basic issues. I'm still waiting to hear from the importer here in Thailand what Husqvarna has to say about it.

But Let me just air my concerns about the bike and hopefully some of you can help me out: 1. Is it EXACTLY the same as the 690SMC such that if putting on another exhaust causes engine issues, that I can reflash it with a KTM tune (like the Akra tune)? 2. Where the heck am I going to find a seat for this thing in those colors or even just one color? 3. Does anyone know how to tune the suspension properly without turning this into a long winded experimental lab bike? 4. Are most KTM SMC farkles plug n play for the 701SM like turn sigs, exhaust, damper, seat, etc 5.

I assume Husqvarna has/will have a mapping for mods which flow more gas through the intake/exhaust. I'm using Wings which does not need to be re-mapped. For seats, I went to James Renazco who custom makes seats to your specs of color, materials, size, etc. Mine choice was blue vinyl sides, tan suede top and a bit taller and wider. The suspension is the latest WP 4CS forks and shocks, 275 mm travel on the 701 Enduro. The 701 SM front end is different from the 701 Enduro front end (less travel, not 4CS, different axle mount, etc.) and more like the 2015 KTM 690 SMC R (not sure if there is a 2016 SMC R). The 701 frames and tanks are different and accessories which fit the grab handle bolts need to be re-designed for the 701 bikes. The bar mounts are different with rubber mounting so damper mounts (and pin mounts) have to be re-designed because of the rubber mounts and frame differences in the front of the frame. I now have a Scotts/BRP mount (no pictures yet) which allows a Scotts damper to be mounted. PowerCell will soon have mounts for the latest Ohlins damper.

The yellow splash matches the yellow in the extra graphics kit. Cover should be available in few weeks, but complete kit (cover & pan) won't be available for another 4 months.

As some of you know, we are working on Luggage rack for 701 for some time now. Here are some details. As you know bolt pattern, angles and overall design of 701's tail is a lot different. Because of the technical differences and different appearance, we designed rack for 701 from the scratch, it is not just remodeled rack for 690. Progress was relatively slow due to many factors, but several prototypes were made and tested on the bike, and production CAD model is now finished. Cooperation with Didado was very interesting and inspiring. Also, this thread was source of few ideas. This rack will have few innovative features, never used on Luggage racks before. Due to nature of the bike, rack was designed with rack-less bags in mind. It has 'G-hook' incorporated in the upper piece of the rack, which should serve as quick release for straps, enabling bags to be moved for refueling easily. There are also two 'G-hooks' on the lower piece of the rack, so straps can be pulled through slots on the upper piece and fixed on those 'G-hooks'. Anyway, like all new stuff, this will have to pass through many hours of field testing, so we will see if it works as intended. This features doesn't compromise other features of the rack, so if someone don't like them, just don't pay attention to it - it won't be in a way. Footprint of the rack is relatively small. This is because rack was designed primarily as strapping point for rack-less bags and for carrying small soft luggage, like Kriega US-5 or US-10. For folks needing larger surface, Extension plate will be made, just like for 690. Since this is first batch, it will take some tome to make custom clamping tooling etc, but I expect first batch to be ready for shipping between May 15th and June 1st.","page":167},{"post":"","page":167},{"post":"Hi all, I've decided to forget the akra 1.

As outlined in the manual and found at my 220 pounds the rear spring is too soft. I was just outside the manuals range for sag plus riding it was mush. I don't think using preload is an acceptable answer to a too soft spring. Husqvarna sells an optional spring but that spring only brings the spring from 75N/mm to 80 N/mm; so I went to Supersoft.com suspension and ordered at 90 N/mm (also bought the stronger adjusting ring). Front seemed ok but that could be due to my height pushing me back a bit on the seat. It may still be necessary to change the front fork spring but I will start with the rear and then decide whether the front needs work. I changed the rear on my Super Tenere as well by 20 N/mm and it transformed the handling. In fact most bikes I own need stronger springs at my size and weight. I do like the handling and think the fork and shock do not need replacing for 95% of us. Our bike does use the same size spring as the SMC but the linkage is slightly different.

So, the adjustments are done only during loop-back mode of operation which occurs only during idle, and cruise conditions where the throttle position is at most a small percentage and relatively unchanging. At any other time, such as during acceleration and wide throttle positions, the fueling is determined directly from stored fueling data for given temperature, elevation, throttle position, rpm, engine load, etc. So the answer is that it can't compensate except during cruise conditions.

He worked as \"the\" guy on Carl Fogarty's Ducati's during his world championships... and others and with various AMA guys here in NA etc.... he designed a wheel clamping system for his bikes in his trailer (road racing and dirt track) to avoid putting sustained long term spring pressure on his forks. Given that the drive time and frequency of dirt track races in the US is huge it makes sense that you might shorten the life of a spring by having it compressed for that amount of time. But he was a superb pro and was very sensitive. But given the amount of time we most likely would be clamping down our bikes it would not do much if anything to the spring. As for bleeding.. I agree with you in that if you look at how much pressure - sustained - that the forks are under and seals during a long day of riding - it is incomprehensible to me - to think that bleeding the forks just for transport and clamping would be of any value. And as you said - they are designed that way.

You can get a lot of slack by loosening (just enough to be able to move the angle of the fitting) the banjo bolt at the master cylinder and route the line mostly down and a bit to the rear. I can see no reason the route the line into the headlight box and immediately out. Use a box knife to make a slit in the side (this won't alter the functionality of the box, then you can route the line down/back behind the right fork tube and gain a significant amount of slack in the line.

You just slide the two webbing loops coming out of the bottom rear of the beavertail into the G-hooks, adjust them once and from then on you leave the alone. To fill up at the gasstation you don't have to undo the beavertail etc. All you do is slacken up the lower webbing attaching the two R40 legs to the frame. Then you pull the reckless back a bit and take the webbing loops out of the G-hooks and slide the Reckless forward so you can get at the gastank. I've been using this basic idea for months with the stock hand holds that come with the bike. But now I have done some riding with the prototype Perun and it works great. Here's a view with the webbing on a prototype (don't judge the finish & bolts etc. The proto's were all unchamfered, no powder coating, ugly protruding bolts etc, just for fitting purposes) I also took the G-hook idea a little further and hacked Perun's heel Guards by milling a slot thereby creating a improvised G-hook for the lower attachment. I have been riding around with this for months now and I love the idea. Taking off a Reckless is so quick and easy with this setup. Just slacken the webbing and the bags come right off. I've even driven many kilometers with the lower webbing slack without me knowing it. It wasn't a problem. The R40 stayed in place. One problem with the hack is that they are not strong enough. I had a crash and the hacked G-hook bent upward and the Reckless cam buckle ripped right out of the webbing. I'll be milling a replaceable one that can be mounted on the Perun heel guards and changed in the field.","page":169},{"post":"","page":169},{"post":"i had a big plan to break mine in but as soon as i hopped on it, game over... breaking it in was done on mile 2","page":169},{"post":"yes... rubber mallet","page":169},{"post":"I made sure that mine were not installed by my dealer.. would be willing to sell them message me if interested.","page":169},{"post":"Very cool, thanks for the prototype pics and write-up.

Only the battery charge circuit attaches directly to the battery. Some accessory connections, such as a GPS harness, are wired to the always hot ACC line with a water proof switch and indicator LED on the HDB top clamp. This allows selective power to whatever device is plugged into the circuit (they all have SAE connectors) without having the ignition on.","page":176},{"post":"","page":176},{"post":"What Ohlins steering damper fits this bike - it is hard to know...

Since I had the first one in WA and a friend of mine owns Konflictmotorsports , and has done other bikes for me as well as pro race bikes for Baja and other Rally events I figured he would be the man for the job. Alex took my bike for a bit to do some 'testing' on, and came up with a plan for the suspension on our bikes. As most of you know it's significantly different than a 690. Once he got the parts machined and/or ordered up he went to work. I got it back last week and it's amazing. My bike was great before but now it's totally better. It handles amazing on the street and soaks up big jumps and hard edges like they're not even there. this is what he did to my bike. 4CS front forks we changed the base valve pistons, midstroke pistons, bottoming cups/needles as well added the adjustable compression adjuster on the bottom of the forks, tying this in with the KM3 level revalve. For the rear shock he completed the KM3 level revalve as well micropolished the shock shaft. Since the bike only had a few hundred miles he didn't bother changing the fork seals or anything like that. If anyone is on the fence about the suspension definitely give Alex a call, he is a great customer service oriented fella and will help you dial in your bike even after your service. For example, I called him from the woods on Friday evening, asking him how to soften it up, and he walked me through each of my clickers over the phone and made some suggestions. Then the next day he calls me back and asks how it went, and offered further explanation about what he did and how it works so that I can dial it in for my riding style.","page":181},{"post":"Thanks for the offer.","page":181},{"post":"","page":181},{"post":"Seat located!!!!","page":181},{"post":"","page":181},{"post":"Ballpark cost?","page":181}]

Thanks to the forum here I have managed to track down someone to make some nice racks for the Husky. The only other current option that I can find in this great world is Rumbux. And although nice the price with shipping to North America is pretty expensive. As no one is currently making the racks for the 70 this has been a pain for me as I wanted to ride with the Wolfman Soft Saddlebags on racks. Anyway - my prayers have been answered! Andrew at DSR DualSportRacks has made a few sets and has decided to make some for us all! dualsportracks@gmail.com Here is his website link - you won’t see them on here just yet. http://www.dualsportracks.com/products/ He has been talking with Nicola at Perun to get them to fit the Perun - 701 - top rack/plate. That has not been confirmed yet. Also - Andrew has done the initial build with a bike with Wings Exhaust so they will fit with that set up - again very cool. Once I get mine I will test fit with the stock “can\" to make sure it also fits that. Colour is powder coat black for now and custom colours can be done but it takes longer to deliver and it will be extra set-up and paint charges $110 (if a group of guys get together for the custom colour - the price will go down) Included in the rack purchase is a nice “case saver” for the sprocket side - in Blue, Black or Grey. This is included in the price. You can see it in the photos attached. Price: Rack for Husqvarna 701 - Enduro Black Powder Coated (additional colours starting at $110 for set-up and paint - cost goes down for multiple racks of the same colour) CNC - Case saver - Black, Blue, Grey Shipping Included in US (will ship anywhere for additional cost to be confirmed) TOTAL = $475 USD​ Andrew will confirm all of the above - I don’t work for him so don’t quote me totally on that. Take a look at the photos - NOT my bike - they are very nice and follow the lines of the bike really well I think. You can request custom options for fitment of other bags for an additional charge starting at $50 bucks to cover his time and custom fab work depending on what exactly you need - Mine will be set up with the common tab mounts for the Wolfman luggage. …Finally my bike is almost done.

I have read most of this thread but cannot seem to find the info that I need. It's hard to find any hard intel or parts specific to the 701 being that it is so new in the USA. I'm in the process of ordering all the stuff I need. The suspension is going off to Konflict in a few days so I'm trying to get all the stuff ordered I by the time the forks come back. I want to do one big build and be done. Question 1. I ordered the BRP sub-mount/Scotts damper now I'm trying to order the hand-guards I like the HDB with the built in mirrors but I cannot confirm if they will work with the BRP sub-mount? they also make a cool looking protection mount for the speedo, No clue if it works on the 701 or will work with the BRP? Question 2. I ordered the rally raid upper tank bolts, they also have a lower tank bolt? I remember replacing the upper on my old 690 but not a lower one? Question 3. Heated grips, I ordered the Oxford grips from the reviews I saw on this thread, has anyone figured out a good mounting place for the controller? Question 4. I ordered the ABS dongle it was specific to the 701 & 1190r on the web site. I heard that this only give the 2 ABS options is this still an issue. I figured i could use it on my 1190 if I can only get 2 modes Question 5. Bar risers or higher bend bars? With the BRP i'm expecting to get an 1\" rise but the stock bars felt very low probably going to have to go up another 1/2\" to 3/4\". Any suggestions I can get on what others have done would be very helpful. I would like to just get a set of new bars that have a little bit higher bend? Then I have to deal with the clutch cable? If anyone have used the BRP and changed out the bars I would love to know what work for you. Question 6. Akrapovic Slip on, do you have to remap after you install this? What I have ordered so far: Please feel free to comment if you think any of these items are a bad choice. G-It bash plate (had one on my old 690 worked great) BRP sub-mount/Scotts damper (came in yesterday very nice) Oxford heated grips (never used them will see, I wish we could do plug and play ones like the 1190R) Cyclops LED (works great on my 1190R) Pivot Pegz (ordered with the extensions lived these on my old 690) Renazco seat (build date in August ) stock seat blows! Sub frame bolts lower tank mount Off road Dongle #rrp-350 Akrapovic Slip on Hammerhead KTM shift lever item # KTM6SL KTM side stand removal switch Tourateck folding break tip (was going to order the heavy duty one but they can bend the shaft in a bad crash, cheaper to buy a new one then deal with a bent shaft) Still need to order: (would love suggestions) A tail rack (thinking the Perun rack if they ever get them out) Led blenkers (haven't found anything I like yet) Hand guards (still looking) Tail tidy (have not been able to find anything yet, Not sure is you even need one.

IMO, if you start with a brand new bike, the primary reason for oil use is unseated rings. There can be other reasons for oil use, of course. The rings seat by rubbing against the cross-hatch pattern in the cylinder bore. Being too gentle with the engine during the first few rides can smooth the cross-hatch so much that the rings will never seat leaving the motor an oil-burner. The best way to fix this problem is disassembly, re-do the cross-hatch and perhaps install new rings. When I get a new bike I try to seat the rings on the first or second ride; usually a highway ride of about 150 miles, then change the oil.

[{"post":"I can't comment on the 701 but I have the Kouba-link for my 690. I originally went with the 1 5/8 inch drop which was a nice but the rear wheel bottomed on the fender/gas tank. No good! So I changed to the 1 inch drop. A little less drop but better than stock. No bottoming out on the fender/gas tank. To compensate in the front I dropped the triple trees 1 inch. I have taken it on single track and up to 100mph. Very stable and steers well. No headshake with this set up. People will tell you that the link takes away some of your rising rate and they are probably correct, but it's not noticeably different for me in the rear. I don't like the front forks that much on my 690 but I did find a setting that I am satisfied with. The 701 has different internals from what I understand so there may be no good comparison between the two up front. Relative to shortening the shock internally with a spacer the Koubalink is cheap and easy to install and also easily removable if it is not to your liking. I bought the 1 5/8\" and lost like $50 when I sold it but then I bought a used 1 inch drop for the same price so there was real loss of money in the switch. It is a quality product and well built. I'm an idiot and made it harder than it needed to be on install. Make sure you take the bash plate off before anything and then the footpegs are easy to remove.

Firstly I wanted a better sump guard, the plastic one didn't really inspire confidence, I didn't want a full on rally spec one (they do one with a 2.5ltr tank built it which is really nice) as my disability limits me to what trails I can ride. The rally raid one is simple but cleverly thought out. It fits perfectly and in a matter of minutes, just remove the two bolts and slide it off, then swap the rear months from yours onto the alloy one and hey presto it's on. They do metal mounts at the back for those who go competition rock bashing. Also it provides a flat jacking surface which I will use. Here is the one with the extra tank fitted . When you look at it you think it's a bit wider than necessary but it's been designed like that to add protection to the cases and levers. I can't notice any difference in vibration or an increase in noise above the plastic one. Really impressed with this. Also fitted radiator protection bars. These are different to the 690 ones as husky has changed the way the radiator mounts, the curve is bigger on the 701, 701 ones will fit the 690 but not the other way round. I imagine it would be very easy to break the rad mounts if you dropped it. Not 100% sure if I like the looks of them but the fit is superb with stainless fittings, and the added protection is piece of mind, not sure if the white is an exact match for the frame but my bike has done 4000miles and a bit grubby but I'm being picky now. Also looked at their 450 rally bike which started life out as a 690! Engine stroked down to a 450 so it can enter the Dakar, when it started up I couldn't believe how smooth it was, the engineering challenge to do this and make it run reliably is immense, but after seeing their passion for these bikes and engines, plus the technology they have at their disposal I can understand why everything works so well.

I'm a Finnish rider and also had to make a decision about the luggage option a couple of months back. The toughest question for me also was to choose either Mosko or Wolfman. They both look great and should be high quality as they definately aren't the cheapest option out there. One thing I was sure of was that I didn't want anything that resembles a banana to ruin the looks of the bike. I also knew I wanted to keep the bike as lightly packed as possible, have some options for placing the bags and alter the bags according to different needs. Plus I wanted refuelling to be as easy as possible. A couple of months back there was no info of the Perun rack's smart G-hooks that probably work great as a strapping point for the Mosko. I ended up going with the Wolfman Dry Saddle Bags WITH WATERPROOF LINERS: http://wolfmanluggage.com/products/enduro-dry-saddle-bags I thought they'd be simple to pack as you can just pack everything into the liners and then slip them into the saddle bags. So far I've been extremely pleased. My legs or bum don't touch the bags and I really don't even notice the bags when I ride and that's the way it should be. I happened to have some old Wolfman enduro bag (not sure, if they still make it) that has really handy hooks for attachment and it only takes a couple of seconds to detach them from the D-hooks of the saddle bags for refuelling. The setup I have on the pic below has been enough for me on weekend trips that haven't required a tent. It's compact and you must think what you pack but it seems this way I'm dragging along less totally useless stuff than I used to with a larger luggage system ;-) And for longer trips I can just choose a larger rolie bag to go on top of the saddle bags. The tank bag is the small Wolfman Expedition Tank Bag as I wanted to try one without zippers as they don't work that well with sand... http://www.windingroads.co.uk/shop/product.php/133/wolfman-expedition-tank-bag Hope my 2 cents were useful to some of you.

[{"post":"If none of the sensors are tampered with the bike will manage the mapping to the prescribed level - so opening up the airbox will allow more air but the computer will readjust the fuel mixture to suit the added oxygen. There should be little or no variation in the mixture. Just more air flow which should help the bike perform a little better - easier to breath less energy to breath more energy to run fast - however the mixture will still be a little on the lean side but close to exactly what it was before the change. The benefit of mapping programmes enhances the mixture to either a different map profile and or mixture to richen up most modern bikes that are designed to meet strict emissions regs. ie. IF the bike was to change enough by opening up the air box - to damage the engine you would get the exact same thing happening if you changed altitude drastically.... it should not happen on a modern fuel injected computerised bike. That is why there are airbox intake sensors - exhaust oxygen sensors etc etc. It is actually how most simple one or two circuit power commanders actually work. The commanders most times on bikes like ours - simply send the incorrect sensor info to the bike to make it think it is running with more or less oxygen and the bike itself compensates and adjusts the mixture - to the fake scenario.... There are however more complex versions out there but for the most part - those simple power mapping devices dont do that much. ie. will also add in flat spots in the power curve.... adjust the richness too much at certain times... The only way to make a true difference is by hooking up a computer with fully infinite mapping adjustment - and programming in new maps... hopefully KTM/Husky will set up a dongle that will do just that or a mapping change as they have with some of there other bikes.

The ecu cannot compute what the mixture should be, i.e. injector duration, but rather it can only make adjustments of a bit more or a bit less. Moreover, adjustments occur only in loop back mode of operation. The ecu enters loop back mode only when the throttle position is relatively low and not varying (cruise). At all other times, fueling is determined from ecu memory tables of air temp, manifold pressure, rpm, throttle position, engine temp, atmospheric pressure, etc.","page":201},{"post":"","page":201},{"post":"That is correct, to richen the mixture you would have to increase the duration as you can't increase the injector size (well not easily anyway) this is normally set in milliseconds at different throttle positions, you would either have to have software that could burn a new map to the ecu or a piggy back device like a power commander.

My 13 690 which I remapped post warranty period suddenly came to life. It's not that it became much faster or quicker, but rather that the engine had more \"body\" to it. Situations that would have required a downshift prior to remapping, were now resolved by rolling on a little more throttle. Adding more throttle in those situations before would make more noise, but the bike didn't go anywhere. After mapping rolling throttle in those situations gained more speed. I had no \"symptoms\" to tell me that the bike was too lean before mapping, only the performance difference post remapping to enlighten me as to how lean the bike had been. I ran Wings with small insert and UNI foam filter from the beginning of ownership. Fuel mileage for me did not change post mapping.

You say it yourself: At all other times, fueling is determined from ecu memory tables of air temp, manifold pressure, rpm, throttle position, engine temp, atmospheric pressure, etc. Which means if you cut open the airbox (manifold pressure, oxygen) then the ecu will take the sensor inputs - pick a map that is best suited for the environment it thinks it is working in and apply its ideal mixture - for that rpm - throttle position. Just like descending 2000 feet. The fuel mixture will always target the ideal (airbox or no airbox) Likewise - if you ad an exhaust can - the flow, velocity, will change - the sensors will indicate a change and the ecu will apply those numbers to the memory tables...... Now the point is - what if any performance gains would one see if you increased airbox or exhaust flow. The dyno also says that you do see gains... but importantly we would see much much more gains if we could adjust the mixture and the mapping.

I had a lot of experience with the 2007-2013 motors which could be remapped with TuneECU. As Sdd04 said, those motors literally came alive with mapping changes after changing the air intake and exhaust. I ran the RR intake and a LeoVince on my 690. It was an awesome bike. The 2014 and later motors are much better out of the box and will respond intake/exhaust changes the same way as earlier 690 motors did once proper maps are available.

I was sceptical of fitting a firmer Spring but when you realise how much preload that has to be wound into the stock Spring you soon realise the benefits of a firmer Spring. On the way home to say there is a marked improvement in mid corner stability would be an understatement. The other big difference is the front now seems better, I had dialled out some compression because I thought it was to firm, but now with a rear Spring better matched to the front forks I have dialled some more compression back in making it brake better as well as ride better. All in all a very good upgrade in deed, well worth the effort. I will post pictures when the correct brackets for the remote have been manufactured.","page":204},{"post":"","page":204}]

I bought a ute from Kyneton recently and loved it up there so wouldn't mind a drive I played with suspension for the first time today, (GB put the ideas into my mind) and I took special note of how the rear shock felt. To me (and I know little about suspension) the rear shock felt fine. I jump this bike and to me it seems to handle the landings really well. On and off road it feels like its pretty good to, what will a firmer spring do for the bike ? Ie what specific issue or characteristic is being corrected by the firmer spring ? I'm wondering what others who know more about this subject would say, me with all my normal riding gear (helmet etc) weigh 97kg (me 87, gear around 10kg - which surprised me). I gave the front one click extra compression and rebound and skittishness = gone on the road. Impressive. It had perhaps a little less feel off road, but was fine to run the slick tracks today.

I'm gonna run it for two weeks then take it out and check all is good then tractive/rally raid will put the wheels in motion. As for the bolts we didn't get around to fitting the top tank mounts you have pictured, just the bottom single mount. The problem with the bottom mount is it is a tube threaded each end with small bolts each end, so when you've undone one there is no way of holding the tube to undo the other one so we had to use a windy gun trying it on each side until they were both undone, fine in a workshop not so good without all the tools, with the rally raid unit it is a tube with one bolt all the way through, an Allen head one side and a nut the other so it's easy to tighten and undo, saves a massive amount of frustration.","page":205},{"post":"","page":205},{"post":"I like that a lot, thank you.

The trip was advertised as a allroad trip. So I thought most of the participants would ride heavier bikes like gs's and 1190's. But when I arrived all I could see were dual sports with mx or enduro tires. I was going to be using the Oem tkc's. First day stress and road conditions hit me like a hammer. After a full month of heavy rain the Morvan area transformed into a slippery enduro park with loads of mud, washed away roads, river crossings, muffer deep basins and loose rocks, Heavy climbs and steep downhill via narrow river beddings. In these conditions the tkc's gave little to no grip. It was sliding and balancing all day long. And,... My electric starter gave up on me the moment I arrived. Starter engine turns but does not lock to the crank, so I had to be pushed or pulled to start her up. So I tried to keep the bike running all day. Second day I skipped 70% of riding and went looking for a proper front tire. I ended up with a Michelin enduro competition 4. I kept the rear TKC. Not a ideal combi, but at least I could point the front in the direction I wanted to go. Most of the time the rear followed. I had a hard time, but I realy learned a LOT, and I am so glad I made this trip. On the third day I actually had loads of fun. A fellow almost professional 690 rider rode my bike a couple of Miles and he told me the bike easily out-performs his 690 in the 'mapping and suspension area. His advice was not to change a thing until my skills were better than his (not going to happen) Compared to this trip,my trans Pyreneeën in Spain was peanuts. I didn't fall a single time, but the bike has some minor battle scarrs on the wheels and where my boots touch the bike. Not the last I am sure. In the next two weeks I have planned two local offroad tours. It keeps raining all over europe so I think I am gonna stick with the enduro tire. Will bring the bike over to my dealer to investgate the starter.

It is a little tiring on the rider on the highway though, needs wind protection and vibrates. Needs a different seat also. At speed it is light feeling and the wind tries to move it around somewhat. I think the wind and the seat problems are fairly easy to resolve, I'm hoping the vibration will lesson as the engine breaks in fully as some say it will.

I just looked up the travel on XR650Rs and they came stock with 285mm front and a whopping 307mm rear - so you may be on to something. Geometry on the XRs is definitely more slack whereas I am much more over the front end on the 701. Am going to try the 75nm rear spring as suggested by GB and then going to go with a lighter weight oil to see if that increases plushness. Will also experiment with dropping oil level slightly. (Trying to come up with simple and cheap solutions because that is all that is available to me). On a separate but related note, I have the feeling that the recent drive to create lighter components has resulted in decreased OEM suspension performance. I don't have any hard data on this, and I am not a suspension expert, but I have been riding dirt bikes for nearly ten years and mountain bikes for twenty. My layman's/seat of my pants observations tell me that older suspension may have been heavier and flexier, but it was plusher. Stock suspension on my 1991 XR250R, 1997 XR600, and 2005 XR650R were all plusher than on my 2013 Beta 498RR and 2016 701 Enduro. My 1995 Rock Shox Mag 21 and 2002-2005 Fox Vanilla RLCs were a million miles better than the complete piece of shit 2015 Rock Shox Reba fork I bought last year. The new suspension is definitely lighter and stiffer, though. When exploring suspension woes on forums, it seems that the well-intentioned advice always is: \"send it to Bob/Joe/Micah at RevalveSports\". I find it interesting that as consumers we are now conditioned to accept that a $1,000-$2,000 suspension rebuild is required on a brand new, $12,000 bike for it to work properly. I know that very light or heavy riders will require a new spring, and I know that racers or people with out of the ordinary suspension needs will need a revalve/rebuild. But I really do think it would be great if manufacturers could provide us with bikes that work for the average rider - straight out of the crate. Rant over. Still enjoying the bike, of course.

The XR650R was designed for desert racing, which is the kind of riding I mostly do. The 701 is an outstanding light adventure bike, which with stock suspension is extremely nimble for its size at slow/medium speeds on all terrain, and high speeds on non-choppy terrain. Given that the XR650R also works as a (low-tech) light adventure bike, this is the bike I should have chosen. I may have simply chosen the wrong horse for the course...","page":209},{"post":"You have hit the nail on the head there. I looked at a xr650 but it was to off road biased for what I want, I want a travel bike that can cruise at motorway speeds and can handle some rough stuff. The big GS1200 did that fine until I had my accident and I now need something lighter hence the 701, on twisty roads it's all over the back of bigger sports bikes and only loses out at silly speeds what I'm not interested in, and it's light enough for me to handle off road.

[{"post":"Brapman I agree with Shawnee Bill's comments and I've written a bit of a review in the Australian regional thread as well. I've owned the F800 and its a good road bike but off road is heavy and the suspension is way too soft for much more than gravel roads. The 701 is more like a big dirt bike and very capable off road. It rides well on road but for extended road riding needs a screen and a bit more comfort to the seat. It is massive fun in the twisties though ! If you are wanting a good workhorse for mostly road riding the beemer may be the way to go but if you want to have fun off road the Husky is much better.

[{"post":"In case anyone is considering the same, I wanted to share that I have just mounted my BRP damper submount kit WITH a Renthal RC High Bar (full 84 mm rise) using the stock clutch and brake lines. Front brake was no problem. Clutch was tighter, so I had to separate the hose from some of the zip-tied groups of cables along the left hand side of the bike. This allowed it to fall into a more natural position and free up slack (instead of running along the top of the valve cover, it now runs along the side of the cylinder head). The bars turn full lock and there is still slack from both lines. I have also dropped the forks until their topcaps are flush with the top surface of the top clamp.

[{"post":"Konflict Suspension Review: After what seem like forever, I was able to get in a 160 mile ride Sat up in Big Bear. This was my first ride on the 701 with the new suspension. I was hesitant to shell out the $$ at first but I have to say I was very impressed at how well this bike performed. It was well worth the money. I'm a big guy at 250lbs and this bike could have cared less how much I weighed. The suspension just sucked up what ever I through at it. No kick outs or bucking and felt very planted and predictable. To my big surprise I could not bottom this bike out. That is normally not the case for me . I haven't been riding that much lately and I wasn't planing on doing that many miles on my first shake out run. This bike was just so comfortable I didn't find myself getting tired or wore out. The only negative of the day was the seat. The stock seat sucks and is a brick. (soon to be changed) Alex over at Konflict is a top notch guy who really cares about the customer. Even called me this morning to follow up to see how I like the bike. I have no affiliation with these guys and would only give them a positive review if I really was happy with the results. They were recommended by some fellow inmates that have work on their suspension on their 690's. I really like the fact that when I called Alex he already knew about the bike's suspension and what was needed to get the most out of it. They were already doing their homework. Others guys I called did not seem to really know much at this time and just seem to just want to sell me heavier springs. If your looking for some suspension upgrades I would definitely give Alex a call.

In hindsight I enjoyed riding the 690 more. I was thinking my skills would improve the more seat time I put on the big bike. I was wrong and struggled to the point I sold it and dropped down to a 530 for awhile to improve my skills. The 701 & the 690 for me has always been the perfect fit for me when you need to be able to do a little bit of everything single track sand and high speed open terrain.

There's a ton of ways to arrange stuff, almost too many for the non-ocd types. There's some strap management to deal with, most of the straps have little \"keepers\" that tuck your excess and avoid flapping in the wind, nice touch. I think after you figure out your own arrangement system, the bag does enrich your riding experience out in the big empty. Only thing is the shipping down under... My basic system (for what its worth): top main: clothes top rear: tent poles, tarp top beaver: jacket storage top molle: water system right side main: tent (no poles), sleeping bag, pad, pillow <-- weight low right side rear: camp chair or 2 1L msr bottles for fuel right side front (molle): toiletries left side main: food, stove, medical, bike cover, misc left side rear: tools (heavy) <-- weight low left side front (molle): single malt left and right are pretty well balanced","page":225},{"post":"No I do not have racks.

For the lower tank bolt system, already the '11-'14 450 RFR had the system from which the upgraded kit was inspired and solves the spinning bolt problem. I really don't understand why KTM solved the issue on the Rally bike and not upgraded the 690 as well, and it's really insane that the newly released 701 with a new tank still has the same faulty design. What's new on the '16 Factory Rally bike... well the threaded area of the bolt has been increased in size from M8 in the past to M10. In order to use those bolts on the 690 or the 701 one need to re-tap the welded nut on the frame from M8 to M10 and presto, you have the strongest solution available (both RRP or Perun upgrade kit uses a M8 high strength bolt mounted from the inside and the big bolt turned into a nut, it's a clever solution but a bit of a pain when you want to take the tank out and at the end of the day they are still M8). My bike is a '09 \"R\" and it's the prototype of KIT690 , so it has been through a lot, over 20k on the Silk Road and 5 Rally Events so it's time to replace the rubber bushing as well since I'm at almost 40k. With constant care and checking that there's no slack on the tank bolts I've had no issues with the OEM bolts, but since it's such a popular upgrade among the 690 and probably 701 owners I've decided to share this information. Here are the OEM PN and the prices in EURO through EU Dealers: Upper tank bolt M10: 76407060000 - 15,84E x2 Upper tank rubber bushing: 76407066000 - 5,52E x2 (not needed on post 2012 models unless they are worn out) Lower tank metal bushing: 76307061000 - 15,80E x1 Lower tank rubber bushing: 76507065100 - 8,41E x2 (not needed on post 2012 models unless they are worn out) To complete the kit you will need a M8x140 bolt, two M8 washers and a nut. You can get them from KTM as well if you want to spend extra $$$.","page":232},{"post":"","page":232},{"post":"Thanks guys for the info.

Fairing: MST (Italy) Contact: Gianluca Calò > marketing@specialthings.it 810.00 EU Notes: Beautiful design - solid well made - fitment was a bit wonky New Lights for MST: Clearwater Darls's $499.00 USD Notes: I have had a few pairs of Clearwaters of varying sizes... They are expensive for sure - very... but to my mind worth it. They increased the Lumens from the included MST lights by 2 x to 4,000 combined... The original MST lights are about the same if not slightly brighter than the standard OEM h4 light on the bike. These are now 3 chip LED's at 2.5 inches and fit right into the MST with a small U shaped bracket I had to make - I am currently making a small block 14mm x 25mm x 25mm to make a better mount but that is really simple and clean - these lights are bright and maybe too bright for town but I pointed the lower light down for low beam and the high beam normal - with both on at high beam I am covered with serious brightness - love the quality and they are american made solid units. Plug and play with minimal wiring into the harness with the kits provided - they do not make a Husky kit but the std kit works with limited wiring and some heat shrink wrap - love heat shrink wrap. Bar Protecters: Highway Dirtbikes (USA) Contact: Paul Degarate > pdegarate@yahoo.com $125.00 USD Notes: Can't say enough about these things - very well made - design is superb and works very well with the top bar clamp set-up to clean up the bars and make adjustments perfect - included tap for direct attachment to bars is brilliant.

Well worth the money and more to my mind. Steering Damper: Ohlins v2.1 & Cyclebuy.com Contact: Aryn Richardson > sales@cyclebuy.com $745.00 shipped to CDA Notes: Okay I admit this was a vanity buy - I love Ohlins stuff and had a chunk of cash sitting around doing nothing (yah right)... But But But it is so nice I almost want to take it to bed with me. And it has a very low profile that meant I dont have to raise my bars at all -that was a key requirement. The MST comes with a ready made damper tab for easy fitment BUT it is designed for the standard (Ohlins) Scotts damper that is available with your MST fairing purchase - which is pretty cool that the fairing mount is all ready to bolt on a nice damper. I did have to mod a tiny block to move two of the holes about 2mm forward but that took an hour with a vice, file and drill - if you have a milling machine and drill press it would be easy and simple and clean. I had to grind down the top of my key to make it fit without having to move and or modify the turn key apparatus. It was any easy solution to do that and the key is not a chip key. It also means that the key can in no way fly out while riding if its even possible and it is protected under the damper. It was a small price to pay for a nice unit like this I thought - you can see the block in the pics - this is such a nice piece and adds to the comfort for off road - the bike is so stable that for low speed or road I dont think it would ever be needed but with the added weight of this bike on high speed rough terrain for sure essential and helps much with fatigue for the longer rides.

I say \"if anything\" because you are changing the fuel slightly so it could have some effect, but not nessessarily help if you're after more power. It would add safety but I believe there's quite a large safety margin in the map to prevent knock. One would have to change the timing table in the map the get any noticiable results. -If there is a \"solid\" timing table that does not make corrections based on knock sensor. I don't know a lot about bikes engine managment so can't say more. Some cars have very sophisticated and accurate knock detection systems so one could take a new car from a showroom floor add octane booster and get more power instantly. Supercharged motors in general benefit hugely from octane booster or water/methanol spray. Because of the high intake air temperatures they create. (depending on setup) I use Shell V-Power so it's already well above the minimum octane rating needed. I would like to do the open airbox mod (I want the sound) but I'm worried that it runs too lean after that. As far as I know the ECU works in open loop when full throttle, so any changes to the hardware would result less than optimal air fuel ratio. And since we are already in the lean end(emissions), it is not advisable. Some say you can do it, or put on the slip on but not both, unless you re-map. Why aren't there any maps available?

TKC, 3k Pirelli Rally, 2k Mitas E10 Dakar - I fitted a Mitas E07 and am pleasantly surprised. Hopefully it lasts a bit longer than its predecessors. Actually, I thought it'd be a lot worse, but the tire's taken me to the same places I use to go to. I'm an awful rider, I've had LC4s before - 640 and 625 SXC - and my lack of technique is blatantly evident. I ride mostly for fun, in short blasts in the nearby of normally less than 100k Km, which usually take some 3 and 1/2 hours. As all the reports I had read about the E07 were from people saying it lasted well over 10 k Km, even from a TKC, Really?? and mostly fitted on bigger bikes I thought a different point of view was missing, so here go my impressions about the E07 : Bike : 701 enduro Tires : front TKC, rear Mitas E07 Bar : front 1,3, rear 1,1. Terrain : mostly dry single track, steep fire roads, some grass and several low sand dunes. 220k Km. loop, including some 40 Km of on road twisties. Impressions : within the expected 50/50 compromise. The tire slides in a predictable way, has decent bite to help you climb and it's not that bad under braking. Compared to the other 50/50 tires mentioned before, I think traction is slightly better once the bike is straight. Good on slab too. It's not I'm deeply concerned about how long a tire lasts as long as it grips accordingly and I don't have to carry a spare for a trip round the corner, but getting only 1k Km of decent grip for what I'd call spirited but not too fast off-road use doesn't sound reasonable.

This a tale of a man and a one finger clutch lever that should've been a five minute job turning out to be 5,12 hour deal at great expense so you're warned. I bought one of those Clever Lever clutch levers from Midwest Mountain Engineering that reduce finger pull by 50% and are nice and short so the lever doesn't hit your other knuckles. According to their application matrix it should fit a 690 so therefore most likely also the 701. Well it does sort of... But not very clever... Two problems. The turn signal/horn/light switch housing on the handlebars is too thick and the lever hits it so you can't pull in the clutch all the way. Second problem is that it doesn't have a little cam like the OEM clutch lever that activates the clutch switch. That last one turned out to be a major headache. Problem one was solved by spending a lot more money... I bought a Sicass Racing EXC/FE-S Multi-Function Bar Switch which is a plug and play replacement with a shallow housing to allow the clutch lever to be pulled in all the way. As an added bonus you can turn off your headlights. I really like that feature because this allows me to charge some electronics with the engine off while camping. However, all this cost me a great deal of money because of shipping costs and duties. It cost me more than double what you actually pay for the lever and the switch. Too much money but once committed I had to get it finished. The second problem was much harder. The lever doesn't actuate the clutch switch which means no starting in gear. I found that unacceptable. If you stall in traffic or on a steep trail you can only start in neutral and that's a no go for me. So ignorant as I am I thought I could fool the 701 by shortening the clutch switch so that the bike thinks the clutch is pulled in at all times. That sort of works but it turns out, and this has been known for years in the 690 community, that the clutch switch changes the mapping when activated. When I Googled this issue the answers are very mysterious. Some people who changed to a an aftermarket lever without clutch switch activation didn't have any problems while others had random stall issues. Well it's not mysterious at all on a 701. Don't shorten the clutch switch because it stalls the bike constantly and at random. I would be driving up to an intersection, pull the clutch and coast a few meters and the bike stalled. Letting go of the clutch didn't start it. I had to push the starter button. On an hours ride this happened at least ten times. In other words the clutch switch not only prevents starting in gear if you don't pull the clutch but it definitely changes the mapping when you pull the clutch. So here the challenge started... The solution was hacking the Clever Lever which, if I may say so, was very Clever of me The original lever has a little dicky sticking out that pushes a small 3mm shaft in the clutch lever housing to activate the switch. The Clever Lever doesn't have this and the geometry is completely different. Luckily for me the hole where the slotted spring pin goes that holds the little swivelling part with the pin that actuates the clutch is exactly in the same place where the little dicky sits on the original lever. In a nut shell I bought a new, longer 6mm stainless steel slotted spring pin. (The original is 5,7mm which is probably an US size) I then drilled out the hole for the pin to 6mm and in the swivelling part to 6.1mm I cut off the spring pin with a length roughly 2mm longer then the clever lever was thick and hammered it in. The pin sticks out 2mm and works like a cam pushing against the clutch switch pin. The original clutch switch pin however, is too short. I turned a new one on my lathe that's about 17 mm long. It took me a while to figure out the required length. When you pull the clutch the switch isn't activated until the lever is pulled in about half way or more. That's important because otherwise you would have that 'clutch-in mapping' while slipping the clutch or taking off. I almost forgot. I had to Dremel the clutch lever housing to remove a tiny bit of Aluminium so that the new 'cam' has space to move. And now I have a brilliant short clutch lever that really works well with one finger and not loosing the ability to start the bike in gear... Just a pity that something simple is so expensive when you don't live in the US.","page":245},{"post":"","page":245}]

The geometry of the side pods is such that in the stock configuration they could not hold any fuel at all, only on the left side you could have some usable space in that hidden box. But that's all it is. I am positive during EICMA we will see an FR450 conversion. There is some info, but can't say much more , KTM is also preparing some news regarding the rally scene.

Bad Fuel Partial Power with super soft delivery Full Power with soft delivery (standard/ stock setting) Full Power with aggressive delivery I know the instruction fixie posted suggest the ignition timing changes (it may well on a carbureted 2 stroke) but.... Note that per ECUTune, the only difference between the Partial and Full Power setting is the throttle map. There are no differences in fueling or ignition timing maps. The Partial Power setting only gives about 60% throttle when 100% is commanded. Both Full Power settings give 100%, the difference being the curve or slope of the throttle table. The Full Power with aggressive delivery does not make any more power than the standard setting, the throttle is just jerkier at partial settings. We don't know what is going on in the Bad Fuel setting as ECUTune doesn't report that map but one could assume it involves a change in ignition timing along with increased fueling. The Bad Fuel map is also the failsafe mode should the switch fail or become unplugged. The TrailTech switch replaces the stock one and offers 3 settings, one of the three is the Bad Fuel setting unfortunately. I say that because if you were to get some bad fuel it would be easy to lift the seat and unplug the switch which then defaults to the Bad Fuel setting. More importantly with only 2 setting available you are stuck with Partial Power (good) and Full Power/aggressive with no stock option (bad for me). Also the quality is only OK. On the other hand the hard Parts switch is very well made but has only 2 setting which is the only bad news. The Hard Parts switch piggie backs in line with the stock switch and allows switching between the stock setting (Full Power/soft) and one other as preselected on the stock switch. This is perfect for me as I have no use for the aggressive map and have yet to have a fuel problem so I preselect the Partial/super soft under the seat and that becomes my option.

If I set the racing sag where I'm fully geared up with luggage on the bike to the required 75/85 mm it requires a preload adjustment on the bike. If you change the preload on the spring then naturally the sag with the bike unloaded has also changed. But the manual keeps talking about it having to be 30mm. Am I missing some point here?

We then fitted the preload adjuster. With no luggage I run very little more than the 8mm, I havent loaded it fully for a like a 2week tour yet but I have done a weekend on it and I wound in about 4-5 turns on the hydraulic adjuster, I tend not to get a tape measure out and measure it, just get it where it feels right.

Having to fiddle a bit is one thing, but suspension that requires a lot of time and money to sort out is absolutely ridiculous on a bike that costs this much and is sold as a premium off-road worthy product. In my opinion, it should come with competent high speed compression damping, but it does not. It is an extraordinary, nimble, powerful, good-looking light adventure bike. But it is definitely not something you can ride fast out of the box in rough terrain that features sharp-edged hits. If you grit through the baseball bat swinging against a lamp post feel, and manage to stay on, you will eventually pinch flat and dent your front rim. Moreover, adjusting rear preload is a right pain in the ass. You can fix these issues, but it will cost you time and considerable extra money (suspension shop revalving the shit out of the fork and an expensive hydraulic remote rear preload adjuster). If you have deep pockets and want a killer, modern light adventure bike, and do not cane it off road, I am hard pressed to think of a better steed. But if you don't mind low-tech, and want a light adventure bike (also with a killer motor) that you can ride the shit out of on rough terrain and tune easily, then there is no better bike than an XR650R. I have owned and pounded the crap out of both all over Tanzania and Kenya. Just my two cents to help anyone who is using this thread to see if a 701 is for them.

I try not to interject \"690isms\" in the 701 thread, but on the off chance that someone may find some bit of it applicable, I going to this time. I'll just apologize up front in case I was wrong.. On my 690, I don't have to remove the shock to change preload. Granted, I'm only 2 bolts away from removing it, but it made for pretty quick adjustments yesterday when I fitted a new spring. I know the 701 has some differences, but for what it's worth.... I first pull off the front side panels. It's likely that I could have left them installed and only removed the rear bolts and popped them outward to give clearance to the pivoting fuel tank. I leave the exhaust intact, but remove the bolts that attach it to the fuel tank. This just requires removing the 2 left side bolts that hold the rear plastic on so that it can be pried up to expose the exhaust bolts. Then I remove the lower tank pivot bolt, and pivot up the tank-I use a tie down going from hand grip around the fuel tank, and back to the other hand grip to hold the tank clear. I have a modified shock perch wrench that I can then either add, or remove preload with. I'll post a pic if interested. I make an adjustment, drop the tank back down, sliding in a long tapered punch into the lower tank sleeve (I have aftermarket tank bolts) to center it, and start measuring. My approach is to set static sag to 18 mm (again, likely different with the 701) with my everyday items on the bike and let race sag be what it is. In my case, that meant before measuring, stacking on top of the seat, the tank bag, tail bag, hoops bags, and the wolfman side and top racks-not bolted on, just set on top of the seat. It took me 3 swings at it to get it where I wanted it to be. I bolted it all back together with all of my everyday crap installed, and my wife helped me check static/race sag one last time, because I'm too oc to not just leave it unchecked lol. Came in at 18/75 which works fine for me. If after setting the static sag, the race sag number is higher than I want, I install a heavier spring and if not high enough, a lighter spring. I don't make any changes from this to riding fully loaded with all my camping kit etc., and have not found the handling of the bike to be a problem. Admittedly, I travel back roads, and dirt roads, and stay off interstates unless there is no other way, and am generally not in a hurry, so my average speed is not overly high. This is however as you mentioned, where the hydraulic adjuster could come in handy. You do need to make sure that if using the hydraulic adjuster that you have enough room to install it without having too much preload at the minimum setting. I have talked with a 690 rider that experienced that problem. YMMV","page":250},{"post":"Yes, I believe it is a direct rip off or Air Hawk is licensing this under another name.

The thing I realy didn't get when I joined the Pyreneeën party in 2015 was that 19 bikers were all travelling with tyre spoons, oil, wrenches, pumps etc. Sure makes you feel like a adventurous lone ranger, but I didn't see the need for 57 tyre spoons to repair 2 flat tyres (that btw were fixed by the experienced guides in order not to loose too much time.) same goes for cooking devices and gas bobbins. One Guy made coffee for all every morning. The other 18 cookers stayed right were they were. You do have to take a kitchenette along when you do the wildcamp hardcore part 2 :) So,... Leave all stuff you don't realy need at home. Talk to each other when you meet next weekend. Who will bring what to the party? Try to take something along the whole group might benefit from. That makes up for the stuff you might have forgotten. Make sure you have a descent tool to loosen your axle nuts. When you want to use the husq tool, make sure the nuts aren't too tight when you leave. The bike itself is ready to fulfill any task on your trip, even with a bit too much sag. It's not Dakar.

But we are all just moderate riders who's capabilities are way below those of the 701, even when the suspension isn't dailed in 100%. Of course when you make a modification you must aim on getting it right. We all want it to be worth the money. But sometimes I think we are so focussed on reaching perfection that we forget what riding is all about. My bike is still kinda standard and I think I will try and keep it that way. I did spend years and loads of money looking for the right bike And the right mods to make it perfect. I am trying another approach now : I am trying to adapt to the bike, and I think this way of looking at it results in more succes :) I am quoting you didado, but maybe my reply is not realy for you: I am just a bit anoyed about the fact that so many people are complaining about the bike.

This post is obviously concerning and something we take extremely seriously, I can’t think of any business that would like to see a post like this but is definitely something we need to address, we have been in business for going over 7 years and I’m sure Mark will attest to the level of customer service he received to ensure things were addressed accordingly. We, like many other small businesses here on the forum are here for the long run. As for this particular project we utilized parts publicly available from a manufacture to address some of the known issues with this particular fork, something we have sourced and utilized a number of times all with great success. I personally tested the settings (in another bike) as well had a long time customer bring his 701 that was just tuned and we tested on our test loop out of the shop and were satisfied with the level of performance we were able to achieve, as many of our other customers have as well since. Under certain circumstances with Marks particular bike there was an issue of it being harsh, but more in the sense of it being too firm as harsh really isn’t the correct term. We would like for all of our customers at Konflict to continue being customers for life, and have made some great friendships that we cherish within the community as of our involvement in the industry. With that being said we are talking custom work whereas nailing it right the first time does not always happen. There are a number of variables that come into consideration, sometimes small variations of information can have a significant change in the outcome of service, not stating that this is the case here but should be mentioned. With that being said we stand behind our work, our company policy is as follows: “Within 60 days if you are unsatisfied with the settings we will make as many revisions as needed to ensure you are satisfied. If in the case, you are unsatisfied we will return the suspension back to stock and complete a refund in the amount minus wear items such as fluid, bushings and seals.” We cover the shipping expense if shipping occurred. This particular bike is coming to us the week after next on the 22nd of this month to test with further, we have the replacement components as the installed items may be defective as all other aspects of the project will be/have been addressed and verified to be working as should. If there are ever any issues, please let us know and we will address the concerns promptly and attentively.

It has to do with the very little voltage your volt meter uses to measure resistance. Under a 12v load, that solenoids internal resistance goes up. That's why your measured resistance is much lower. A solenoid doesn't behave exactly like a resistor. It's internal resistance will vary with temperature, load, and position.

Your dealer will almost certainly do nothing. The solution is as follows: - remove the airbox - clean it thoroughly inside and out, making sure there is no grease residue anywhere - with the cover/snorkel off and filter out, inspect the seam between the top flange and the body of the main air box. These two parts are ultrasonically welded together and they often have gaps that let dust in. The easiest way to do this is by putting a small flashlight inside the air box and looking for light leaking through from the outside. Some people also use a .010 feeler gauge. If you find any light leaking, run a bead of silicone calk around the outside edge to seal it. You may want to do this anyway, as it can only help... (photo credit inmate corsegoldkid) - next, take a sharp knife/razor blade and trim any flash (plastic debris) from the inside edge of the top flange (sometimes this can be excessive and it won't allow the filter to seat properly). - re-reinstall the airbox, add a thick layer of filter grease to the lip of the top of the box where the filter sits, reinstall a new filter and the cover/snorkel You may also choose to swap out the paper filter for an aftermarket foam (K&N) or cotton gauze (DNA) style filter.

That bike had AC only (no DC or rectifier/regulator or battery). I used KTM front/rear light parts and an extra wiring harness which came with a KTM e-starter for the bike. That harness, strangely, ran the bike (AC for ECU and DC for lights and battery charging) from 1/2 of the stator output, not using the other 1/2 of the stator output. I moved the lights and battery charging to the other half of the stator output which meant the lights were attached directly to the battery, so the switch had to turn them off. The parking light in the OEM light housing may need to be moved to a different connector pin or just disconnected since there is no way to use the parking light as a parking light with that switch.

I too have successfully broken in a couple bikes and cars and never had an issue with oil consumption before. That said, I was surprised to see that the allowable oil consumption is less than or equal to \"0.7qt./600mi.\" I suppose if I had it to do again, I might actually be a little harder on it, but I didn't even start riding it on the highway at steady speed until I had a few hundred miles on it.

Mounted vertically will helpfully prevent further issues: Smooth sailing (except for a sore ass) till Creston. From there we made it to rock creek where it was painfully obvious I should've purchased a new rear tire BEFORE the trip. I did manage about 6500km until this happened: Decided to try and make it from Rock Creek to Penticton, where a Dunlop Sportsmart 2 awaited at Honda Powersports. My riding partner was getting frustrated with delays (tire, traffic) and unfortunately low sided his bike on this corner on the crowsnest pass: Lessons here: 1. Don't ride while frustrated/emotional 2. ATGATT - he was wearing jeans and even though it was a low speed crash, he tore them open and now has a bum knee/hip/Palm/elbow. He was wearing a proper jacket, but since it wasn't zipped into pants it rode up and he suffered hip rash as a result. We did make it to Langley, where my cousin runs Supersport Motorcycle Works. If you need bike parts, Dave will sort you out. My buddy was pretty sore 48hrs after dumping his bike, and decided to fly home. I ended up snagging a Ride Share off Craigslist and got the bikes from YVR->YYC for $200. Impressions after putting 1500km in 3 days on a stock 701 Supermoto: 1. Need a seat concepts tall seat, 30mm lower pegs, bar risers. Being 6'7 does make the OEM configuration a bit cramped 2. Need saddlebags! 50lbs in the backpack sucked 3. Stock headlight sucks - luckily most riding was done during the day 4. The bike consumes SIGNIFICANTLY less oil during highway riding. I brought 1litre thinking I'd use it all fairly quickly. All said, used about 200ml during the whole trip. 5. Elevation affects these bikes - the 701 feels significantly torquier @ sea level vs 1100m of elevation. 6. Windshield would've been nice 7.

Seems crazy to me that a motor would take that long to seat. I just changed to synthetic after 2,000 miles and a 110 mile track day. I had only used 1 quart the first 2,000 miles. A half quart of that one quart needed after the track day.","page":268},{"post":"Except the manual states that the breakin time is 1000km, IIRC, and not 10000km.

And just keep topping off.","page":268},{"post":"","page":268},{"post":"I think this is BS as KTM puts full syn in the bike at the factory. This has been verified by taking an oil sample from a new 690 and sending it for analysis along with another sample of the recommended Motorex. The lab verified that the oils were the same. I've used a technique similar to MotorMan's on two new bikes manufactured by KTM on the very first ride (150 - 180 miles) with great success. Neither bike uses any oil between changes. If you don't get the rings seated on that first or second ride, they may never properly seat. There is a YouTube video of the KTM motor/bike manufacturing process. Motors are hand assembled, usually by a single assembler. Then they are run fairly hard on an engine dyno to check power output and leaking. The oil is then replaced and the motor goes into inventory. Later, when a bike is assembled, a motor is pulled from inventory and a few techs build the bike. When complete, the bike is run fairly hard on a chassis dyno to check power and leaking. The oil you get in the new bike is that oil and it is full syn. On my two break-ins, I replaced the oil after the first ride. The filters were rather dirty and lots of metal/epoxy debris in the screens. A second oil change was done at approximately the recommended 620 mile distance and the oil screens and filters were rather clean.

Similar to knee slider material. As it wears just rotate it a bit and voila; fresh surface. Also the pegs are a bit smaller than stock and just over a half inch more leg room. The grip surface works very well.","page":268},{"post":"The Oil debate rages but there is no debate. I agree with you DirtJack. The break in oil is mostly a myth especially considering most motorcycles run wet clutches so that the usual suspect in non seating rings in some cars being the friction modifiers are not present in moto oils. Even so most new cars today come broken in and with synthetic oils.... More important is HOW you run the bike during break in - frequent heat cycles and cool down periods. Shorter run periods and no no no lugging the engine. Most people run the bike too softly during initial break in periods and dont allow the engine to actually break in by riding style. Oil has nothing to do with it. Break in oils actually add more friction modifiers to protect new engine parts like cams and rockers so defeat the myth in that regard. Full synth new - full synth during or whatever good quality Mineral oil you want.","page":268},{"post":"","page":268},{"post":"Spoken like a guy who has not yet had an oil burner.......Good info on break in riding suggestions.....There is more to getting rings to seat in today's HARD chrome sprayed in cylinder liners than avoiding friction modifiers in car oils.","page":268},{"post":"","page":268}]

Other than some quick short rides in the local area specifically for engine break-in this was the first ride out in the world where I could really assess things. I took advantage of my proximity to the WABDR and some perfect weather and rode Section 3 of the WABDR (Ellensburg to Cashmere) out and back which ended up being an excellent test run with quite a few different conditions to test things on. I need to get my pics organize and posted so you can see what thing looks like, but I'll use this post to comment on two of the biggest issues below. First though in terms of how I came to buy a 701 allow me to explain. I've been lusting for a KTM 690 for a couple of years now and almost pulled the trigger on one early this year. I had been riding a 2014 R1200GSW and really loving it for the most part, but though it is lighter than its predecessor it's still a heavy beast. It performs amazingly offroad for its size and I'm now a big believer in all the electronics, but at the end of the day it is still a large beast and though I've been riding both on and off road since I was 14 I'm now 60 years old and not as strong and tough as I used to be. I also typically ride alone and became increasingly uncomfortable with the notion of the GS going down in some remote location, maybe on top of me, and not being able to get out. A vision started to emerge for an ADV-lite bike and I had targeted the KTM 690 as the ideal platform. It was over 200 lbs lighter , had all the KTM performance virtues, and sounded like the perfect platform. Now I'm 5'9\" with a 30\" inseam and always appreciate a lower bike. That said I also don't want to compromise away any suspension performance. The GS has 19/17 wheels and frankly I thought they did just fine in the nastiest trail conditions I'd want to ride. In other threads here on ADVrider there has been quite a bit of discussion on converting 21/18 bikes to 19/17 with much positive feedback. HERE is a link to the Woody's thread on this issue if you're interested, you might check the first post for the list of reasons one might consider this, and these were my reasons also. So, the vision emerged for a 690 with the 19/17 wheel mod and a list of farkles gleaned from surfing ADVrider, but just after the wheel mod was the suspension. One of the issues I read about was that the front suspension would need work on the 690. As the Husky was released and I learned more about it, mostly by reading this thread, the supposedly improved suspension and many of the other small tweaks won me over. Turns out there is also a new Husqvarna dealer in town right on my way to work. I pulled the trigger, bought the bike on 8/6/2016, rode it the 1.5 miles home and promptly removed the wheels and sent them to the good folks at Woody's. The project had begun. I then started down my list: Perun parts, Wings exhaust, Adventure Spec skid plate, BRP SUB mount and Scott's damper, etc., etc. So, let me get back to the point of this thread, commenting on the two most important areas... SUSPENSION Having read all about the harshness of the 701 suspension I dialed out all of the fork compression damping and almost all of the rear shock's high speed compression damping. Just riding over curbs around town and bouncing it in the garage I could feel an improvement, but was it good enough? Well, my impressions from my ride are that the rear spring rate is just fine for me with the stock spring, and even the stock preload setting. I'm getting 3.25\" of rider sag for my 170 lbs which I think i perfect. When I ride along and bounce the whole bike up and down both ends seem to compress the same which tells me the springs f/r are about right. I launched off a few drainage swales and landed the bike somewhat hard and couldn't bottom anything so I'll conclude that I don't need the RR 75nm spring that several of you have commented on. If anything the rear springs feel right but the fork might be a bit too much spring. My initial rebound settings f/r were close, just some minor tweaks there, so in a nutshell the suspension overall is pretty good EXCEPT for the excessive high-speed compression damping both front and rear. Riding at all quickly over rocky terrain just seems way rougher than it should be, yet it seems to absorb the low-speed compressions, whoops and swales, just about right. I think the harshness is more noticeable in the front, but both ends are not as plush as I would expect or like. Now, what to do about it. I'm doing suspension research now and considering what to do, but regarding suspension, should I start a thread just on 701E suspension, or should it be kept here in what is becoming a megathread? What say the group? 19/17 WHEEL CONVERSION No surprises here, I'm liking the whee/tire set-up already. The bike is a bit lower to the ground overall which improves mounting/dismounting, dabs in tough terrain when needed, and I can just touch my toes at a stop light when slid up on the seat. The wider TKC80s (110/80-19, 150/70-17) track well, get decent traction, allow more aggressive cornering on the pavement, and I think are more stable at high speed on the street (though I never rode it with the original wheels on the freeway). I have fitted a 42t rear sprocket (OEM is 45t) to bring the gearing back and am pleased to report that the compromise of 1st gear trail work to 6th gear freeway work seems about perfect. ​ That's it for now. I'd appreciate some comments on whether to start a new thread on 701 suspension or not, and also any work any inmates have done on the harshness. I'll be all over this and will post what I find, but I already found one there, check THIS LINK . Anyone tried adjusting the fluid level?","page":274},{"post":"","page":274},{"post":"trailcruiser, my vote is separate thread just to secure a good future suspension reference point, but either way I'm looking forward to hearing your insights. Sounds like you've been around the block a few times so appreciate your wiliness to share your 60 years of wisdom. I'm doing my best to avoid spending the big $$$ on complete re-valve/re-build or even different shocks. As you mentioned, the high speed compression seems to be niggle.

I'm really reluctant to cut any wires because I don't want to hassle with the microsurgery of reconnecting them.

Quick question for my fellow 701 enduro owners : Do you know if replacing the stock exhaust for a smaller one will allow enough space to grab the bike at the rear ?

With this subframe configuration I would avoid putting to much force directly the rear (if it's just for handling it's no problem but if you're stuck in the mud that might be different). A luggage rack als supports at the pillion mounts so in my opinion is better to grab.","page":277}]

This is done by injecting air behind an exhaust valve. A side benefit is that the oxidation occurs in and around the CAT and helps bring the CAT up to operating temperature more quickly so its chemical reactions can occur. After initial warm up, the SAS valve is closed and remains closed since the mixture is no longer overly rich. Some CATs use heaters for startup heating, but this is not often used on single cylinder motorcycles.","page":276},{"post":"","page":276},{"post":"The 2012 US 690 had SAI/SAS","page":276},{"post":"","page":276},{"post":"They can make the old engine meet Euro 4 emissions.

[{"post":"It was a dream trip! The first 9 days I travelled by myself from the east coast to the west coast through the Pyrenees. I had downloaded a route from wikiloc that was supposed to be half tarmac, half off road but thanx to my Garmin Zumo 590 it was 3/4 tarmac and 1/4 off road. What a piece of crap navigation that is. I've taken courses on Basecamp, tested it at home but no matter what it hardly ever took me on the route I wanted even with hard way points. This is one of the worst pieces of hard- and software I have come across in all my years of testing gadgets for a living. But I still had a dream trip Then after my crossing of the Pyrenees I met up with the EnduroFun guys to cross the Pyrenees again. The first week was an absolute blast and the group was a bunch of great guys. The routes were great and we had plenty of little adventures of people dropping bikes including one that went over the edge of a mountain side but luckily some bushes stopped the bike from total loss etc etc. Riding in a paid, organized guided group with different skill levels however has its own dynamic. There's lots of waiting while you're boiling away in the blazing sun, yet at the same time there's no time for yourself. You're entire day is determined by the guide and I'm not sure that's for me. At the end of the first week I was totally exhausted from more than two weeks of nonstop riding and camping. I did get a bungalow to rest for two days. Anyway, the picture was taken on the first day of the second, hardcore EnduroFun week where the entire week was camping in the wild. It was the hardest day of the week. I was the only person also doing the second week. Just to sum it up. The day started at 7. The temperatures for the week were going to be between 34 and 38 C and by 14.00 I had already completely overheated. We stopped for a few hours at a restaurant so I could cool off and we sat out the hottest part of the day. By 17.00 we were back in the mountains when one of the new guests who said the riding 'was really easy' dropped his BMW GS for the second time and broke his leg. Since this was a remote mountainroad we had to put the guy on the back of the guides' Honda Africa Twin who bounced down the trail with his 'broken' passenger to meet up with an ambulance. Anyway, after dropping the poor guy off we continued at around 18.00 to the big challenge, the Col de Gran Misere as the guides call it. That's where the picture was taken. Its perhaps a 150 meter section with only two hairpins with nothing but rounded rocks like marbles. Just giving it a little throttle I buried the bike almost to the axle in rocks. On the left of the picture you see a bit of luggage. That was a BMW 800 GS who's clutch had givin out in this spot. Very convenient. It took all 6 of us to drag the bike up hill. By now daylight was almost gone and we still had a little ways to go to our camp site. With al my headlights on I barely made it up the mountain. I have never ridden off road in the dark and that's an entire new dimension. I started setting up my tent in the dark. We were camping illegally and used our lights as little as possible. I thought the day was over but then the guide rode into the camp and said he needed help. One of the guys was totally exhausted, the BMW was still stuck and the battery on a KTM 990 had died. I walked down the mountain in the dark with a lithium starter powerbank (great stuff, saved us several times). At about 22.30 all of us were in camp utterly exhausted... The next two days were awesome riding but I couldn't enjoy it anymore. I was utterly exhausted from riding for weeks and I also needed to be captain on my own ship again I decided to go my own way and I didn't finish the second week. I did meet up with the guys for lunch every day. I really discovered that at 54 and less then two years after recovering from cancer my body doesn't recuperate like it used to. Had I continued I would have really increased the risk of an accident. I'm really happy I made the decision to stop because even when I returned to Amsterdam 5 days later I was still exhausted from the trip. Anyway, the 701 performed flawless even after about ten drops. The only 'malfunctions' I had were a dead lithium battery because I spent an evening with Garmin Basecamp on my laptop feeding from the bike, a flat front tire and a rear brake pedal bolt vibrating out (the one you adjust the free play with). I do think I will change the sprockets to a different configuration. First gear is just a bit too tall for my limited skills. I dropped the bike several times because I stalled it. Sure the fault lies with my skills but a little help could go a long way","page":275},{"post":"","page":275},{"post":"nice report, more pictures please if you also put a track of the route into the 590 then there is no problem.","page":275},{"post":"Dunlop Sportsmart 2 seems good.

Hopefully this one lasts a little longer.","page":275},{"post":"Hi Guys, I follow the thread wit a lot of attention since I am really interested in buying a 701 Enduro this year. But still I didn't manage to read the whole thread, so I hope it has not been mentioned before: On January 1st, 2017 the new emission-rule \"Euro4\" is going to be obligatory for newly registered bikes in the whole EU! So to all the speculations when which Motorcycle will get the new engine of the 2016 Duke, there will not be sold any 690 bikes (Husky or KTM) with the old engine in 2017 in Europe since they only pass \"Euro3\" emissions. I am sure that putting the new engine in the 2016 Duke was the final test if the engine is ready to go. I think it would be a hassle for KTM to sell the same MC's with different engines to different markets. So I guess by 2017 all of them will have the new engine. There has been a lot of discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the new engine in the German KTM Forum. The opionions are pretty split so to say. On one hand the new engine is even more powerful in high revs, but has lost even more punch in the low revs. The second counterbalance shaft in the head seems to work very good which, on one hand, kills pretty much all vibrations, on the other hand, \"it doesn't even feels like a one-cylinder anymore\" like a KTM official put it (I think he meant that in a positive way...)","page":275},{"post":"","page":275},{"post":"That is a good point but what if the current 690 engine is already euro 4 complient ?

So I am guessing you may see a KTM 690 with new motor at the same time the Husky 701 gets that motor. I have no idea of the details on any 800 twin KTM motor which may be coming. But I doubt very seriously that a parallel twin is going to fit in either the 690 or 701 frames--too narrow! FWIW","page":275},{"post":"","page":275}]

I installed a TrailTech Hourmeter and Tach just to get a baseline sense of what RPMs I'm at in various conditions. I was originally going to take it off once I had checked the idle speed and shift points, etc. I ended up leaving it on and I occasionally glance at it out of boredom or curiosity. As an added bonus, there's a max RPM feature that displays the maximum revs during the last run cycle for a few seconds just after you power the motor off. Also, it runs on a watch battery, so there's no power to hook up. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AR2R090/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474042618&sr=sr-1&keywords=trail-tech Downsides are: Slow 0.5 second refresh rate isn't exactly the best solution for real-time readings. Battery is non-replaceable. Installation is similar to any other digital aftermarket tach: Wrap the signal lead around an ignition wire. Sounds simple but on the 701 I had to take the dual spark coil pack off and drill three tiny holes in the plastic body so I could get the wire around the outboard coil three times. There are other ways to do this but I didn't feel like digging out the soldering kit. Since it's a coil-on-plug setup you can't just wrap the signal wire around the spark plug wire. Interesting side note: With my Flatland Racing skidplate installed, the motor makes a distinctly difference sound at and above 6500rpm. This has become my shift indicator when merging onto the superslab or just shredding gnar. I took the plate off to confirm that's what causes it and sure enough that skid plate makes the motor sound like a 600cc sport bike at and above 6500.

I just can't se myself getting a GS800 or Tiger, so I think the KTM or Husqvarna are still my top choices ... So really, whats the big difference between the two? The KTM comes with Dunlop 606 tires instead of the TKC 80s, and honestly for what I'd be building the bike for the TKC 80s are a better choice. So far I know the triple clamps on the Husky are at a slightly larger rake than on the KTM and it has slightly more suspension travel, but other than that from what I can tell its essentially the same bike.

It was really good for slow technical stuff and reduced the amount of clutch slipping you have to do. 16/48 is the same final ratio as the stock 15/45.

To lengthen an existing chain, you need 2 or 4 links (for this application) of the same brand of chain and two rivet links. The part number for the OEM rivet link is 78010166100.

FRAME: Inspection and no cracked paint on welds and generally okay. FUEL TANK / FUEL PUMP: Replace in tank fuel filter, screen and gaskets. When removing pump assembly, filter housing was loose on the pump and screen was not attached to the pump. Inspection of fuel filter was dirty, screen was clean. AIR BOX: A bit dirty but overall okay. Keeping a thin bead of grease on the filter seems to work at keeping the dust out of the box. AIR FILTER: Dirty and replaced. Flushed filter with compressed periodically to keep clean. FASTENERS: Checked all misc. bolt and nuts for loose fitting. All tight and okay.

I was skeptical at first because I was worried that it was going to be an overdone TactiCool product festooned with superfluous molle loops, buckles and blah blah. Having stuff flapping around enrages me, which is one of the reasons I normally run a GL bag. The Reckless bags actually kick serious ass. They are awesome. The main thing I love about them is the holster set up. The GL bags are great for long trips but not great if you want to be getting in and out of your bag a lot. The holster system on the Reckless lets me either fill the side bags like a saddle bag, or use the included drybags that slot right in. Way better for the commuting and urban errand duties, in my opinion, than the GL. I ride my bike HARD off road and my commute to work involves an off road section with some mildly technical footpaths and several jumps. The bags stay on really well and the multitude of straps let me cinch things down. I did not install the heat shield for the exhaust and I do not use a pannier frame. No problems at all, although they would probably move a bit less with a pannier frame. My only gripe is that I could not get the mounting straps that run through the passenger peg mounts to cinch down tight. Not Mosko's fault, just the really tight angle on the peg mount bunches up the strap so it doesn't slide well during cinching. Just added two carabiners I found in my garage to resolve the problem. Will see if the bag stays put more during tomorrow's commute. The top compartment is great. Transported a small cooler on there with no budging! Hope this helps any potential buyers.","page":288},{"post":"My Powerlet socket is on the old dash.

Firstly, Im coming from a highly modified DR650, now a 790, which allegedly has about 55HP according to third party dyno. For the bike's weight, it rips and is killer offroad. The weight is manageable, but you notice it when going slow and technical if you come off your line. Recovering from dumping it can be challenging when in a hairy area. The thing is, I love the torquey power, especially since enduro riding is my general purpose- apart from road sumo with a wheel swap. Im looking at one of those 2017 FEs listed above, and Im confused. Between the 350 / 450/ 501, there is only about a 10-20 lb (kilo?) weight difference, and the horsepower isnt stated in the catalogue specs. The 2016s are listed as, 46hp (350), 53hp (450), and 58hp (501). Id like it to jam primarily in enduro settings and still handle 60mph and below comfortably on road- maybe about 65mph would be realistic max. anything more road oriented, I can just ride the DR that day. I have heard raves about the 350 which is what i'm initially leaning towards, since my DR can be my long-haul adv bike. I want the new bike to go most anywhere in the backcountry with authority including single track. But, with the weights being pretty similar, why wouldn't I want a higher HP engine over lesser? How would it affect the ability to hit different trails? People say the feel of less engine inertia makes the bike feel lighter, but ive no experience with the matter. Why cant the 501 kill singletrack just as good as the 350 if they weigh almost the same? Can the mapping and exhaust be uncorked giving more horsepower on these? I assume even the 350 will feel more aggressive due to the fuel injection vs the carb on the DR, plus the lighter weight making perceived gains as well. Any advice or thoughts? Im in a quandary.

The 701 is a lot different up around the headstem area to the 690 so chances are it was going to happen sooner rather than later. Guess it's the gamble you take when purchasing.

You can't remove the sensor at the rear left until you have the rear of the tank up a bit. Don't forget the hose on the left. Once free of the TB you lift the rear and twist to the left and the nose of the air box comes out easy as pie.

It would stay put better with the Shift rack, I believe. 2) My idea to put carabiners on the passenger footpeg brackets for looping the bottom straps of the MM 80 was idiotic. The swingarm rubbed on them and now has some nice gouges (fortunately not a structural problem). A smaller D-ring attached to a hose clamp would be better. 3) The three rear straps on the MM 80 arrived improperly threaded through the friction buckles. Once threaded through properly, they hold really well. I love this bag setup. 4) Highway Dirt Bikes makes awesome products and Paul's customer service is incredible. That being said, I do want to point out that the Ultimate Handguards just are not compatible with the Renthal High RC bar. The longer touring guards that Paul very kindly sent are long enough (standard ones are not), but I had to saw about an inch off the tips so that they would fit with my BRP submount, ADV clamp and computer mount. Once that was sorted, the only way I could get them to work was by giving the tips a serious bend on the vice, and flipping the swivel boss around so it could rotate. Of course, this now means that the guard will move just as easy as a standard handguard in a fall, which defeats the purpose of going with the Ultimates. If you have a Renthal High RC bar, go with the HDB NexGens. Those work really well. Will shoot Paul an email to keep him updated. This is just a compatibility issue that I wanted to raise, which is not Paul's fault. He makes excellent kit and is super to work with. The RC High just happens to be pretty extreme (super wide and high rise). 5) Rally Management Services universal navigation mounts will not fit with the BRP submount, HDB Adv clamp, and HDB computer mount. 6) The HDB computer mount is a really simple, cheap, and awesome mod. 7) Clutch slave cylinder went out at 3,500 kms. Removed, checked, and as indicated by another inmate, the seal around the piston had come loose. I refitted, remounted, and within 50 meters the same issue happened again (same as with other inmate). RR UK replacement on order. 8) Fitted heavier weight RR shock spring. Reduced preload. Bike actually has static sag now and the geometry feels a million times better (not so bucked over the front). 9) Replaced fork oil with 2.5 weight in a bid to improve high speed compression damping. Fork feels better, just waiting for replacement clutch slave cylinder so I can test it. Cheers","page":312}]

I just performed the 6,200mi. service and when I checked the valve lash, 3 of the four valves were in spec, but the right exhaust valve was showing a larger gap than spec. This was not what I would have expected from a bike with less than 10k on the odo. My 701 consumes about 1 liter of oil every 1,000mi. so it wasn't completely surprised that there might be some deposits on and around the valve seat. This would perhaps explain the increase in valve lash. Then I found that one of the two sparkplugs (the iridium one) that came with the bike from the factory was the wrong spec. I even checked against the parts fiches and the owner's manual / FSM. It was one grade \"colder\" than spec according to all sources. Hmm. I also noticed that the same plug had a severe coating of deposits on it. Long story short, I put in the correct plugs and the bike is peppy again. It happened so gradually, I didn't notice but the bike had lost a LOT of power. Now it feels like 67HP again! I also added some fuel conditioner to help break down some of the deposits.

That sort of works but it turns out, and this has been known for years in the 690 community, that the clutch switch changes the mapping when activated. When I Googled this issue the answers are very mysterious. Some people who changed to a an aftermarket lever without clutch switch activation didn't have any problems while others had random stall issues. Well it's not mysterious at all on a 701. Don't shorten the clutch switch because it stalls the bike constantly and at random. I would be driving up to an intersection, pull the clutch and coast a few meters and the bike stalled. Letting go of the clutch didn't start it. I had to push the starter button. On an hours ride this happened at least ten times.

Long answer: Looks like you are not aware , but the 2017 701 has the new single cylinder engine , which is much smoother than the 2016 701 or the 2016 ktm 690, It is the same engine as in the new Duke 690. It is described as smoother than a gs800 , no vibrations at all and it is rated at 74 hp to the crank , compared to 67 hp to the crank for the \"old\" engine. So yes the 701 2017 is currently the king of adventure/dual sport/enduro'ish of bikes. Combining very low weight to power ratio and very smooth ride for long tours , this bike is the best single cylinder you can get. The ktm 690 enduro 2017 still has the old engine.

The engines on the Husky and the KTM are called LC4's and they are identical depending on the year. In other words, a bit of research and you would find out that the Husky 701 is a KTM 690 Enduro/SMC. The engines on the 2016 models are identical engines, sharing 99% of their parts.

Heat? the Bike is cool. Ergos are super comfortable. Still the 701 seat even tho it is more comfortable than the 690 smcr it is still literally a pain in the ass . 1 thing for sure is this. A friend of mine who is a bike enthusiast (supersport rider mainly) he is very intelligent and know his stuff very well. Also a good rider. I let him ride my bike and he loved it. 5 months later I let him ride it again and he still loves it. And then while sitting for launch I was talking about the difference in power band between singles and inline 4s and he thought i was joking about the 701 being a single. He couldn't believe it. He told me that he thought it was 2 cylinders at least...considering he can ride very well I let it slide and didn't mock his knowledge about bikes. But it shows you how much capable the bike is.. That much should tell you what kind of beast is going to be in between your legs. For the 2017 model you get 74hp to crank now that is scary...Put on an aftermarket exhaust and aftermarket air system + tune it and u will hit 80+ hp from a single cylinder!

For a knobby the 216 front is incredibly... Smooth (haha) the rear is better offroad than the TKC, but in slick mud it is still a compromise. That is the problem with a dual sport adventure bike. The more extreme your riding becomes, the less tyre choise you have. I asked you about the height of your seat because you will sit about 2cms higher with the gt's mounted. I have a allroad extreme event coming up. All day long riding in slick clay. I am thinking of mounting a soft knobby rear just for the winter. It will inspire confidence in the mud, and I will use the gt723 for my next big trip. On rocks this tyre rules. It can be ran very low pressure without pinching your tube. My Clake clutch arrived. Fits the 701 just fine, but I will have to deal with the microswitch issue. Yesterday I went shopping to check out possibilities. I've checked out a magnetic read switch, but it is not as accurate as a simple Puch button. For example : it switches on when magneet is 1cm from the switch, but switches out when magnet is 1,5cm away. Don't know if a hall sensor is more accurate. If it is I will have to use a realy to open/close the circuit. Think it would be best to just try and install a shock and waterproof switch somewhere. Did you try to ride the bike with the switch detached from the clutch (with the circuit open)? In that case it will run in the 'gearing' full power map all the time. I presume the button closes 2 different circuits : one to be able to operate the electric starter with clutch pulled in when the bike is in gear, and one to select the 'neutral/idle mapping. Wouldn't it be possible to make a bridge in the dedicaded relay to be able to start the bike in gear, while always using the power map? It is possible the idle map is also used for programming (the 15 minutes idle setup thingy). Opinions and inside information on this would be very much appriciated.","page":353},{"post":"Yep first knobbies. Don't know if you saw the post but I posted pictures of the Rayz seat specifically for you. Anyway, the seat is naturally thicker by several cm but I don't even notice it anymore.

Short circuited it stalled when coasting to stop lights and not engaged you can't start in gear.

Its a $350 kit and they couldn't have bothered sending you a proper 20mm long bolt to thread through both sides of the mount into the new air intake mount instead of screwing around trying to put one nut or screw in between the frame tabs?

I used to have a CBR600RR, and loved thrashing that around the winding country roads back and forth to work. With the 500 EXC I find I avoid riding too much on the road because it just isn't comfortable, instead I seek out the best and longest forest trails/gravel roads I can find nearby. The problem is that the 500 EXC is so good off road that I get tempted to ride in places that are illegal (which is basically anything that isn't a proper gravel road here in Norway), and as such its talents are largly wasted. For my next bike my only real criteria is that it doesn't vibrate to an annoying degree. I have a fairly good tolerance for lack of comfort features and I could happily do long journeys on my 500 EXC if it didn't, a, vibrate like a paintshaker, and b, make me feel like I am destroying it due to the lack of a cush drive and excessive maintenance requirements. So I have narrowed my choice down to two bikes, the Husky 701, and the KTM 1290 SAR. If I get the 701 I will be riding more technical trails (but also be tempted to do things that aren't 100% legal), and still have the option to do some transport stretches on road in moderate comfort. If I get the 1290 I can do much longer road rides, and have fun with that powerful engine, while still getting by just fine on easily 90% of the riding I have done so far with the 500 EXC. In any case bikes are just toys (for me) so I don't have any requirements set in stone :)","page":354},{"post":"","page":354},{"post":"The 2016 701 as mentioned several times barely vibrates , yes it does vibrate but only if u shift too early.

The best example and i quote \"It is as smooth if not smoother than a gs800\" now that comes from GB.UK and Didado who both have over 10000 miles-ish on the 2016 miles. I would get the ktm 1290 SAR if I plan to cross countries. The 2016 701 can max out at 120 mph and you can cruise comfortably at 80-95 mph (2017 model probably can do 125'ish mph+ cuz of the new engine) if u do get windscreen , heated grips and such comfy accessories. I did it without those comfy accessories it can do it but u will be slightly tired out. Oh did I mention that the 701 can carry a passenger?

I have an R1200GS and I have no problem with gravel and dry forest roads, but if it gets muddy, it's not the right bike, and I don't think any 500 lb+ bike on street tires would be much better.

According to EU registration it has to have an angle of max. 30° from vertical, up to 40° is tolerated most times. Then there is this nice little part made by my KTM Dealer: (cut off the original plug and soldered it on the Evotech light) and completed with a rather expensive (30,- to 35,- EUR) numberplate light from evotech the result is this: When using the exisiting holes you just have to make one more hole to bolt on the numberplate: (Yes, I could have washed the bike...sorry!)

And this is how it looks in the end: The tail is just a little bit longer than the rear wheel, so no problem while pushing the bike backwards - as soon as you hit a wall the rear wheel does the same. Since the numberplate light is also angled a bit to the rear and the LEDs are rather bright you can see the white light shining backwards.

It makes installing the housing just a tad bit more of a nuisance. I also installed my RR Golan Super Mini Filter in the fuel line. I did this mainly because my 2017 vibrates so badly that it causes the dreaded gas foam lock where the engine completely stalls. Just imagine a gasoline milkshake in your fuel line and you get the idea. On the 2016 there was a lot of room but 2017 701 real estate under the air filter is at a premium. I cut the quick release of the fuel tank hose and attached the filter on one side directly to the fuel tank line and the quick release to the other side. There's barely enough room to press the filter in a small space. However, you can pull the filter out of the frame a bit. By using regular hose clamps I can take out the filter in the field without having to take half the bike apart. That's very handy because the 2017 is plaqued with such serious vibrations that it cause foam lock at least twice a week if not more often.","page":358},{"post":"","page":358},{"post":"I have been thinking about the Golan filter for the 17 for the same reason but wasnt sure if there was space or not to fit it.

Intresting question may be: do Dal Soccio take all the midspeed damping out of the pistons? This would end in a total new compressiondampingsetup on the lower damping shims. A tip.: changeing a unadjusted shimstack to a adjustable one, needs a stronger setting. At about 15 % until 20 % harder. This is because the klickers should be in about a third until a half of the possible klicks the adjusters provide. Generaly this would be the best way to create a plush and bottomingresistant setting.","page":366},{"post":"Offer is open, we have a sunny 20deg here, and don't even get me started if we take the boat and get the bikes in Crete I am 85kg and the bike behaves ok when loaded.

The Rally parts add to the weight and the front suspension was not up to the task, should the rider asked for 'more' during off road. I talked once with a well known KTM mechanic, who still does spannering during Xmas races, and he told me ''Don't know why they bother saying it 'enduro'. It's better to swap forks with something else'. The rear was adequate I think for normal stuff, but the front needed (imo) more attention. I guess it also heavily depends on what terrain/rider we are talking about and the load on the bike. I used to do trails on the 640 Adv (back in the days) and may be I am over the top, asking more than expected from the front.
