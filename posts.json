    "body": "I'm certainly no tycoon and don't play one on the internet, but I just don't get the business logic of KTM moving established KTM models to the Husqvarna brand. Assuming the 701 is, for all practical purposes, the 690 Enduro, and the KTM version is to be discontinued, then my preferred dealer (and the only KTM dealer in my area) will simply not carry them, despite the 690 having probably been his most successfully-selling among all street-legal KTMs. I'm sure he's still not going to set up an additional separate Husky dealership just to continue selling the 701. I can understand, for example, Honda's requiring separate dealerships for its motorcycles and its power products or watercraft. But the whole KTM/Husky thing is, in my mind, more akin to Yamaha/Star or Kawasaki/Vulcan or Suzuki/Boulevard, at least from the potential buyer's perspective. I mean, it looks like KTM wants to eventually brand its off-road race bikes KTM, and its non-competition bikes Husky, just to keep a marquee alive (or merely resurrected). In the US market, it seems to me to just confuse the customer; always an impediment to sales. I'm not a dealer and no one has told me this directly, but I've come to suspect from reading between the lines that a KTM dealer can't just order n bikes of a particular model he that he knows he can sell in his market area; he has to select multi-model \"packages\" which offer minimal flexibility. He ends up with a glut of expensive models for which there just isn't any interest in his primary market (his area of expertise, not KTM's). Maybe all brands have similar requirements to some measure, but if so, I suspect to a much less restrictive degree. I wonder if that's not part of the evidently wide-spread \"shortage\" of available 690 Enduros. JET",
